1292125_a2071866|but the americans planned everything, and then they play the innocent and say that they went there first.
1187218_a3191583|so the chewing gum needs to go.
1585453_a1936464|everyone marched more demandingly.
1584198_a2659972|exactly.
1583964_a2030372|that's what saved you.
1212176_a2751596|when i was young, i was in the hearing world a lot.
1431222_a2139477|as an advertisement to bring in new people.
1177860_a3021123|not your problem.
1176340_a2192967|i didn't want to hurt the others and therefore i left them alone.
1212176_a2752093|are you interested in culture?
1429737_a2758449|they offered swim training.
1247205_a2239848|the compensation money got raised due to the length of the lawsuit.
1249620_a2689260|i hope the deaf will remain.
1181838_a2773849|i didn't understand why the towers suddenly collapsed. my head was spinning.
1584411_a2071239|then he would have had to go to boarding school.
1430592_a2269528|after three years i had a girl.
1427368_a3243181|i’m wondering why i can’t also change to mülheim.
1182062_a2775385|the mall in hamburg is the most beautiful one in the whole area.
1249951_a2846606|and then, as soon as it's cooler, people start complaining about the cold and want it to be warm again.
1179389_a3530442|many things have to be regulated until that works again.
1429310_a2260845|ukraine is in the east, oh well.
1431982_a3082387|the son pics out a few selected trees.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2804829|i’m a house wife now.
1200691_a2171173|it's easier for me this way.
1433543_a3025517|the women have the symbol, but i can’t think of anything for men.
1427114-10034345-10053342_a2260395|when we travelled by intercity express from dortmund to cologne to go to school, we communicated in dgs, too.
1179224_a3257122|they are currently constructing hafencity, and it’s very modern.
1177860_a3146222|she is coming of age. it’s her 18th birthday.
1245820_a2971195|the integration office then says, 'there you go. it works well.'
1184367_a2569533|it was bad.
1209746_a2023248|they didn't know why.
1184756_a3095691|right, one of those trailers.
1419931_a2315939|it's bad.
1179868_a2869087|when/
1178147_a2723486|what it's called exactly, i don't remember.
1584198_a3838863|he denied it, but i doubted him and we got into a fight.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2813956|it was an old building.
1212402_a2771306|towards the end of that time, the kids were really loud while they were playing.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767629|we had great conversations.
1292125_a2063475|my whole family was sleeping.
1428905_a2406170|in the u.s., the world trade center collapsed.
1248862_a2784313|they made a lot of calls.
1210825_a3258850|at the practical training, i got a 1 [german grading system, corresponding to an a] in everything, but in school it was a 5 or 6 in everything [german grading system, corresponding to e and f respectively].
1585453_a2903670|the sign mob.
1431676_a3248723|those parents that did their children wrong by raising them with their strict believes.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2394841|even if born deaf - it's not the child's fault.
1178347_a2898753|it remains a really bad incident.
1205568_a2810602|i took up my courage to go to companies/
1184749_a2769448|when the hearing person then looks at me as i sign, i feel stupid and sick, and he looks at me, shocked.
1244978_a2443582|unfortunately, a student told my teacher about it. i got into trouble and my teacher ranted about horror movies being bad.
1433543_a2998140|if one meets up/
1210763_a2726488|one thing that i really loved and which i would love to repeat with my family — even though i'm almost 20 now — is: going to disneyland together.
1413703_a2323632|so, it‘s 300 euros each.
1250646_a3069357|on women’s day, the firm/ no, not the firm, the veb [volkseigener betrieb, publicly owned operation: legal form of most industrial operations in the gdr]/
1432043_a2966844|the north-/ east-/ the north sea and baltic sea have a lot of beaches that people like to visit to go swimming.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2293986|there is one more peculiarity.
1211752_a2744783|i need to know what the dates look like.
1209309-13425110-13472919_a2790317|compared to ten years ago, when the smoke was hanging in the air.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2899761|wait a minute, it all started in hamburg.
1212218_a2934171|it’s miraculous.
1212218_a2970219|it could be the hotel’s address as well.
1182062_a2772410|that's it.
1244796_a3079843|on the assembly line the information just rushes right past you and you never know what is coming next.
1291243_a2642248|it has a flash but it’s not sufficient.
1248862_a2783794|it said that i had missed out on a lot of the small dots.
1431896_a3010831|a while later, we started with the job assistance and i had my own real interpreter.
1431690_a2142294|it is, but we also have a river down in the valley.
1582654_a2659306|clips, right.
1290581_a2934081|i had my own little pool.
1181027_a2167258|the film that was shown right in beginning was incredible.
1583964_a2022488|i took my bike out of the car, checked if everything was working, and drove off.
1181838_a2841810|this part is very commonly known.
1244978_a2443059|there was no boarding school, yet when i was in day care.
1220195_a2048144|… i told her there are more and more cis nowadays.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2001944|so i was good and well-behaved.
1429964_a2198887|he was scolding her really loudly.
1178768_a1995327|i thought what he did was great.
1210208_a2795255|… i was really surprised and couldn’t quite believe it.
1183703_a2760751|they also fled to the czech republic and poland.
1431690_a2172900|therefore, i can't imagine building a house that close to water.
1205503_a2772538|they know how to act normally.
1183917_a2869875|phi phi would probably be better.
1427114-10034345-10053342_a2260679|yes, sure, there's more.
1209077_a2249280|there may be lesser then, but they won't disappear.
1433543_a3023907|everyone complains about the noise.
1183426_a2788175|no, no. just me. my brother also cried.
1429310_a2267537|i agree.
1245462_a2318871|the german sign language caught the eye of many athletes during the conversations and the events. a lot of them liked the german sign language.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2901965|i have it every once in a while when i am sick, have a cold or severe headaches.
1247205_a2239634|i was driving a little fast, and it was dark outside.
1427810_a2456820|that’s like kaisergemüse [vegetable mix].
1210825_a3187634|both classes used the oral method, but they were separated into 1a and 1b nonetheless.
1204239_a3069570|some are from the black forest area.
1205821_a2527852|nice. something just crossed my mind/
1183917_a2869894|the whole area looked like nothing had happened!
1184367_a2569559|how did they do it?
1212176_a2753976|i learned how to do it using numbers.
1427810_a2456802|that’s interesting.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787528|my mother.
1583950_a3282504|if someone asks me whether i’d like to go bowling, i immediately have to say no.
1290126_a2457389|of course, they wanted that person gone for political reasons.
1248862_a2783745|i thought that was the reason.
1582654_a3109529|forget it!
1431676_a3250565|there are many deaf muslims in cologne, as well.
1248090_a2699706|that‘s so? are they far behind, and are they catching up?
1413925_a2804953|i forgot; it doesn’t matter.
1204891_a2759090|i followed everything on tv.
1414312_a2778027|slowly my first son is able to manage eight hours a day.
1427810_a2456893|then everyone will stare and check out how i drive.
1210156-17573900-18041027_a3231152|a deaf person joined and went, “hey, i know you!
1418858_a2927609|i don’t know them.
1582205_a2905191|yes.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3162081|because of france/
1178939_a3040383|but a lot of people were already signing, even before that.
1413683_a2706721|
1427810_a3024607|that’s her opinion.
1176566_a1706038|i think it will stay that way. the number of members won't decrease.
1418858_a2929684|what was the name?
1247205_a2212789|everything turned out fine, since, luckily, our communication went very well.
1427368_a3243423|then it’s easier for me to describe why i’m feeling bad.
2025500_a3270317|my daughter said it would be simple.
1180097_a1683930|right in one of the first lessons something bad happened.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2814374|it wasn’t long, just one year, because the company i worked for went out of business.
1209077_a2251342|there's a discussion at the moment whether to say ‘deaf’ [gehörlos] or ‘deaf’ [taub].
1289462_a2395816|but i don’t notice it as a deaf person.
1248941-12280641-12344740_a2930497|what do you do if you have an extremely important appointment?
1245820_a2865685|the best thing would be to just let the interpreters do their work, subsequently forwarding the bill.
1247205_a2243895|
1289462_a2398087|or you send up some waste monthly.
1584855_a1998321|she said she felt cold and she wanted to go home.
1184756_a3101442|one of the women locked eyes with me.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2789781|how about yourself?
1414563_a3030480|i wanted to leave the gdr and go to the west, but it was hopeless.
1182801_a1943775|that's a thing of the past.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1776735|yes, i know that sport courses are available here.
1249620_a2598817|if i had a hearing child, i’d be lucky.
1177860_a3169070|yes, he is retired.
1244742_a2458675|we as the organization planned basketball and soccer games.
2025500_a3273012|that‘s why.
1180546_a3009725|so this helmet is forbidden to use while riding motorcycles, mopeds and motor scooters.
1211515_a3248396|hey, we took the bikes/
1181455_a2296851|i am proud of my hometown sinsheim.
1419265_a2972110|if the woman had knelt there, sweating.
1210997_a2738082|while watching something, i always got distracted.
1414312_a2772276|the sign language festival in berlin was very nice.
2021499_a2597812|how were they supposed to calculate how it would be to have planes crashing into the buildings?
1211515_a3248791|but i couldn’t go back when i was a bit older because i had to work instead.
1419610-11552205-12003930_a3388999|i really don’t care. i don’t know what all of this is, anyway.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2400152|they got improved.
1292768_a2364041|no, my parents were clueless.
1249620_a2688395|exactly!
1583214_a1859996|the bird always flew around everywhere.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2878910|that’s what made it complicated.
1432043_a3041036|you can usually get them in close proximity to the beach.
1177860_a3156750|i will also talk to some people there.
1419607_a3394677|such bad luck. i have experienced it myself and i think that is incredible.
1249376_a2842737|yes, right.
1413683_a2563704|now, i even get to experience some more cultural life because i'm getting too old to engage in sports any longer.
1433543_a2985076|right, to show the beer culture.
1582841_a1783814|tentatively?
1211515_a3245607|those other teachers/
1176846_a2890667|so #name6 and i were invited to my son #name1 and his girlfriend's party.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2394971|some people can't sign then, that's exhausting.
1430832_a2445790|“it's true. gunter is dead. that's it.”
1248090_a2699761|she was glad to have some cultural input.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a1999185|it's not enough to live, though.
1211531_a2046450|that wasn't necessary.
1177860_a3194360|they/
1289793_a3030524|us two, we should know this.
1250059_a2478701|i felt quite lost.
1413251_a3057505|my identity, to me, means that i grew up with the german language, culture and history.
1247199_a2209867|yes, something like fate.
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3008737|others have started to sign green, but i still use this sign for it.
1583882_a1976758|therefore i don't want a tty. i'm very content with oovoo and instant messengers.
1177436_a3149437|i haven’t, either.
1413925_a2787905|i came home after finishing work for the day.
1427810_a3030314|i thought/
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3289340|the reason was, that my bed was so hard.
1428805_a3046952|i didn’t have any visible bump on the neck.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3158065|i saw it and didn‘t mind at all.
1249741_a2797472|let me think what else there is.
1212611_a2780642|so i told my story, what had happened to me, to which i only received an “uh-huh”.
1247849_a2821070|i know that the president can’t decide by himself, the parliament decides with him.
1180097_a1707728|otherwise it would have been an infringement, and your driving test would have been over.
1180254_a2176664|on the one hand i never made the experience but on the other hand i loved my hobbies, which i used to practice at home.
1585089_a2474926|yes, what an asshole.
1413485_a2132279|one of them married recently.
1178133_a2899875|that was it.
1248400_a2711597|yes, i understood that.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3156948|soon, in 2010, ‘11 the new winter season starts.
1177436_a3017553|unfortunately i haven’t heard anything about that topic.
1583964_a2021438|i helped until late at night.
1431224_a2153797|it is the second time they cancelled, right?
1582654_a3145099|they all used international sign.
1583950_a3250013|my mother raised me well.
1211752_a2755758|i don’t know where we will go for lunch, though.
1248400_a2740005|but before that the government announced that they would be running for another ten years.
1413703_a2310542|was it in denmark?
1178939_a2986418|sign language was used and i felt comfortable with the people.
1177436_a3167213|how/
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1768464|if someone deaf wants to get a ci, let them.
1248505_a2747745|didn't one person survive?
1245820_a2868079|neither has there been one concerning the health insurance companies.
1210997_a2726596|
1584855_a1998252|but the restaurant owner was cold as ice and didn't open the door.
1204877_a2951558|i was off on mondays and didn’t know what to do there.
1428038_a2790745|you say it's possible that we'll be living on the moon in the future. but is there air? can we breath like we do here on earth?
1184145_a3013009|oh well.
1209006_a2909723|much more expensive.
1248862_a2783754|in order to do so, they darken the room, then you put your chin into this sort of retainer and cover one eye.
1204239_a3066784|oh right, you have soccer, nine-pin bowling, badminton and so much more.
1429310_a2261185|i thought you have to take a test to see if you use stimulants or not.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1781109|we see each other once a week. we meet up then.
1177292_a2321592|they ask how to do it, and why things are signed the way they are signed.
1178939_a3033413|how are they supposed to communicate with the other teachers, though?
1583214_a1859914|but everyone kept asking.
1182343_a1851585|right. it just crosses my mind; it was the same with my daughter.
1179868_a2559824|all of a sudden, the fence was struck by lightning and there were sparks and i saw how it started to burn.
1211515_a3245373|wait, what did you do on sundays? did you go window-shopping or for walks?
1210825_a3262824|she was flabbergasted.
1419370_a3290747|but that just isn’t the case. it was because of the interpreter who didn’t do well; i just couldn‘t understand him.
1246772_a2388705|sure. can i find that online?
1413485_a2142047|i know diana and the grandma for example.
1584855_a1994699|the car was loaded onto the back.
1205503_a2771641|and then when i/
1181011_a2144987|i can imagine, that the whole thing of a secret operation is just a theory and not true after all.
1179224_a3275605|so, billstedt is at the top of the parts of town drawing hartz iv, second and third place are langenhorn and wilhelmsburg.
1433543_a2983249|i was happy with it. i’d like to do it again.
1183846_a2865152|this way i developed a fascination and an interest for it and i finally managed to get an angle on these abstract topics.
1427368_a3242158|it is as if they stole my money to use it for east germany.
1427368_a3231989|that’s just how it was.
1292458_a2987009|they included the metro area, now it’s a big city.
1249951_a2766645|there was a great period last year in mid-december.
1418889_a2744113|then i started an apprenticeship, that was in berlin, too.
1247199_a2196916|he wished to enable his six children to get good education.
2025500_a3276953|when the new chairperson is elected, said person might be a bit overwhelmed with the situation in the beginning.
1177002_a3259857|well, i think a lot has changed due to globalisation.
1245820_a2855432|do you know it by heart?

1211752_a2744606|because i’ve been to the ones in stuttgart and heilbronn so many times already/
1413925_a2790309|i don’t exactly know what the reason for it all was, though.
1204877_a2985709|for nine years, i didn’t have a job during the winter.
1419370_a3283646|you have to pay so much more for fully qualified interpreters. not everyone can afford it.
1247205_a2243925|i am thirsty and would like to drink some water.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2293984|i can't think of anything else.
1180097_a2908930|i keep rolling backwards because of the chair‘s wheels.
1583964_a2022402|the entire area was closed down because of the flood.
1431676_a3248829|our work is similar to that of the german association of the deaf.
1182062_a2773321|but it really differs.
1211075_a2910005|yes, that's the way it is.
1432043_a2962275|it was a nice time.
1210208_a2796009|that is still the question, isn’t it.
1250646_a3099262|in berlin you could get anything.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a2005320|they deducted more taxes from rich people to balance it.
1248090_a2960717|i understood that they were from england, and i told them that i‘m from germany.
1250646_a3069833|when they came back, they marched around the company’s premises in the evening.
1184164_a2768466|we got up to 1400.
1413251_a2975704|that’s already enough.
1246772_a2811210|true.
1431690_a2142441|
1419931_a2252341|and the spree, because there are many possible ways to go for a walk along the spree.
1413703_a2323658|300 euros each is a good offer.
1427725_a2701327|you can already see transparent/
1181159_a3218731|when i was there, there were plenty of nuns around.
1187154_a3077592|she answers, “well, it’s been repaired, done.”
1184536_a2406329|he said he uses german sometimes, but no bsl or asl at all when teaching english.
1428821-16453820-16510849_a3186861|it’s usually a green box like this, which contains many different things and materials.
1177436_a3152471|but the us/
1428821-16453820-16510849_a3186942|there are those tools that have various holes in them, i don’t like those at all.
1177918_a2893774|so all the way along the equator.
1183203_a3148582|but what about parents that have children with cis? will they understand them when their parents try to explain something to them, or won’t they?
1177278_a2865507|but the question “why?” remained.
1245462_a2296486|if the signs would always stay the same, it would be pretty boring.
1584855_a1998308|no, we didn't have anything like that.
1431896_a2984852|yes, exactly.
1431428_a2525708|i didn't go there by myself. my family was there, as well.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2819632|but now, getting a ci wouldn’t make any sense for you anyway.
1432043_a2961926|the kohlfest in dithmarschen.
1210208_a2796649|there weren’t any victims here in passau.
1181027_a2171840|he wanted to concentrate more on the youth, wanted to promote and strengthen them.
1420216_a2771782|to seal off everything with sand bags.
1181159_a3223213|that was the hardest thing for me.
1246329_a2764228|
1184145_a2813564|you can’t compare that.
1178939_a3037611|i saw that randomly. it was about a deaf coda.
1431676_a3250646|interesting.
1249951_a2767137|i only check the forecast to be able to estimate the weather if i'm going to meet someone that day.
1291164_a3117598|and the older person, #name3, has died as well. therefore there aren’t that many left.
1291572_a2693743|more proper, but yes, you can compare the bible to that.
1290996-15110219-15155045_a2075463|the picture shows the incident which shocked me when it happened.
1431676_a3250608|ask away.
1209077_a2255428|that way you could really improve.
1418858_a2932578|nice, i hope so, otherwise we won’t have the money.
1211752_a2750570|i can be thick-skinned!
1182062_a2773252|it was a really bad month; i’ll never forget that.
1414123_a2755607|he wanted to recruit me for water polo, too.
1184756_a3134023|i guess, i’ll have to take the car or bike then.
1582841_a1783842|yes, i stayed in dresden after i finished my a levels.
1204239_a3246175|every year i get my christmas bonus.
1419607_a3409927|that makes me angry.
1413925_a3559781|true.
1181011_a2143998|the white people didn't let them, though.
1582205_a2905137|that’s the vvv’s job.
1432043_a2967659|five times.
1182062_a2772600|there's one shop right next to the other. they have everything.
1582654_a2659404|is it the same asl as in the us?
1429964_a2199683|it was great.
1584617_a3261264|
1176566_a1706090|i've already told him that he should be careful and step back a little, there is nothing else i can do.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2901266|i am known for my sign language course in günzburg.
1413683_a2563235|i, as a german-born man should marry a german woman.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2899337|someone came to me.
1413251_a2987824|in germany, there are deaf people from baden-wuerttemberg, bavaria or cologne, for example.
1248400_a2752536|if one piece is a little crooked, they fix them really quickly.
1584198_a3179636|i did have to be on short time once.
1250721_a3347003|but i already wanted to apply for disability pension before that, that was when i was 58 years old.
1244742_a2481219|i also had to see if everything was going the way it was supposed to.
1248862_a2784254|“um, what’s that?”
1584545_a2202902|well, there used to be brown coal just right outside and around leipzig.
1292458_a3023993|oh well.
1204694_a2790617|they couldn’t continue with their relationship, so they ended it.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3158061|however, the knitting of the wool was very thick.
1183703_a2766015|east and west germany were united again; that was beautiful.
1289793_a2958588|it’s in herford, in the lower level of the store klingenthal.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2402672|just/
1291572_a2713186|he translated it into german.
1211283_a2761382|i was always there if something was going on.
1292770_a2393892|“oh, good.“
1244796_a3077857|we sometimes have the same sign for different words in dgs.
1249376_a2843117|nuclear power plants, i don’t want those.
1249951_a2766680|that's interesting. i thought you were saying it's part of the city center.
1245356_a3032274|the first one is shy and introverted.
1414563_a2987907|so, i was constantly looking for other children who came from deaf families.
1419607_a3409793|i saw it but i did not worry about it, since everything went well.
1209006_a2558137|there were a lot of people there and many of them were deaf.
1248090_a2695945|we went there.
1582654_a3102958|i just let it be.
1211752_a2743763|that’s funny, the grapes get cut off.
1177697_a3024063|doesn’t matter what kind of shoes.
1210208_a2458000|yes, they went to rome.
1429910-16075041-16115817_a3076054|i wanted a window seat.
1210206-11564230-11595227_a2779626|i don’t know how all of that happened.
1290581_a2954477|that’s why.
1184089_a2773091|papers are bought by everyone.
1247205_a2243947|i returned to wiesbaden because that‘s where i grew up.
1180724_a2663300|they shouldn't focus solely on spoken language.
1177860_a3194368|all the remains will be used up.
1180556_a3726820|…and then also red, but then white also exists/
1205568_a2887000|the boss didn’t understand me and really didn‘t have much interest in me.
1204191_a2784383|wait.
1248862_a2786452|okay, so i put on my clothes.
1290126_a3241439|i think all of that is very interesting.
1179868_a2587950|better live on a mountain in the south.
1419607_a3417973|i have experienced a lot of incredible things.
1182343_a1855917|they are enthusiastic about it; all of their three children are great.
1584855_a1994724|the three hearing people were suddenly talking flabbergasted about the trabant's engine bay.
1204191_a2787076|i first went to kindergarten for two years and then to school.
1180556_a2613518|it is getting better. but the awareness for the topic needs to be spread more widely.
1181011_a2145011|oh stop it!
1247800_a3077744|there’s a crosswalk which you walk over.
1247835_a2607724|yes, they were all hard of hearing.
1250059_a2518431|how old were you back then?
1184536_a2437011|that’s what they call it there, ‘black coffee.’
1414503_a2774071|she came to me, then called the fire department.
1250646_a3022269|i had a 601.
1177436_a3166612|or there’s very few, one, two/
1184145_a2810161|and then you can go outside to the flea market, with all its seller stands.
1585089_a3122832|i think it‘s five different motor sport races.
1210825_a3263583|he wouldn’t have had to, because the ninety per cent i delivered would have been enough.
1245462_a2381820|i prefer to live life to its fullest.
1210997_a2757468|i didn't know many of them.
1247205_a2238541|she came over and told me to carry the bag. i accepted it.
1183846_a2876494|you're right, they have that there.
1184756_a3142021|he‘s with/
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2888030|it's nonsense.
1247525_a3911270|i’ve hardly got the time at the moment.
1182062_a2781111|only inside.
1976261_a2742471|when she got a child/
1584855_a1993151|for what?"
1184756_a3135561|there are only two exams left, then i’m done.
1248699_a2750749|i didn't know.
1176566_a1705593|you've stayed part of the board for a long time.
1413451-11105600-11163240_a2836144|yet, my parents didn't do anything. i had to take action myself. it was exhausting.
1209910_a3030848|yes, a badge.
1210997_a2734653|i was the first to have that idea.
1205821_a2492534|it was a very tight community.
1429781-12565132-12585506_a2358447|he also just negotiated it like that.
1211752_a2752699|alligator, it’s like a crocodile.
1245599_a3080212|
1429964_a2205643|when she went to school in aachen, she took the bus home.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2002258|i absolutely didn't want that.
1246100_a2781077|i just met up with one guy and he really was weird.
1427725_a2098587|
1431676_a3250539|it is the central council of moslems in germany.
1289462_a2396280|when the conversation is over, he turns the hearing aids off again.
1289793_a2935302|i really think you should go.
1289793_a2958503|older people usually wear older clothes.
1413451-11105600-11163240_a2836194|there were some problems communication-wise and with bullying, and i was upset, because i received bad grades. it was tough.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2294154|i didn't know about the sweeping, neither about the old cigarette packets for the 25th birthday.
1584545_a2843012|it was really nice.
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3008673|it is different.
1184536_a2487396|there are mentally challenged deaf people, and interpreters have to work hard with them.
1245356_a2772660|she was brave enough then, and could do it.
1251308-15333326-15350303_a3082130|she just had to wait until the sun was in the right position and then she could start.
1206172_a3077462|together, father and son walk into the dining room, where a table is set with cups and saucers.
1205821_a2492471|so they didn’t renovate the houses, either?
1220195_a2056254|my goodness, my brother was his godfather.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2298250|osnabrück has its own specific architectural style.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2273756|it's really bad actually.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2000211|she came down with a severe flu.
1248400_a2729243|the nuclear power plant in japan was too close to the ocean.
1290581_a3243754|
1183203_a3180240|the child/
1178768_a1995372|his movements were also easy to get for hearing people.
1413240_a3135185|everything is okay and she steps back from the window.
1184367_a2568230|everyone likes to unwind and go watch a movie.
1414123_a2767669|i switched to vocational school by age 15.
1204239_a3078605|it’s good for the body, and the movements are simple.
1245390_a2782743|in the school in friedberg.
1182135_a2750581|yeah, that was it, caveman.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2785861|where is the fiscal revenue supposed to come from, then?
1584545_a2205196|any more?
1582399-11073030-11154047_a2857651|it took the train fourteen days.
1291572_a2713192|the lutheran one.
1413451-11171532-11201836_a2861843|for example, while being in essen, i regularly had to get up early on the weekends to go to soccer games.
1433543_a3025411|everyone meets up there and plays music together.
1177054_a3052426|but it looks so narrow on the sign.
1184164_a2902517|see!
1181455_a2963062|it is?
1584545_a2842755|you didn't see it then.
1246329_a2840637|but when they turned to write something on the board while speaking, i couldn't get any of it.
1205821_a2492350|that was nonsense, of course.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2899767|my mother refused.
1431690_a2142213|the flood had already reached trier.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3162095|just fold it over the bust, and then pull the belt through. there are several ways to do it.
1430592_a2899316|but other than that, i have no problems.
1247835_a2739057|but not anymore.
1292545_a2517542|that's great.
1204191_a2787172|we were taught to keep things in order.
1181159_a3217438|you had to pay.
1413703_a2323540|so, i was able to buy a lot of stuff for little money because i‘m deaf, and he gave me a discount.
1292458_a3057728|yes.
1584855_a1998244|so i knocked.
1220195_a2047189|or something could go wrong so a facial nerve paralysis could happen, or the whole body could get paralyzed by the procedure at the back of the head, so he told her.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2914837|that's why my siblings/
1204239_a2623283|ah, that’s an advantage that you get something by the state.
1430328_a2178883|there is also a sports museum.
1212611_a2779142|a deaf person from my class wanted to get his own way and continued to sign.
1289793_a2939269|it’s been around for ages.
1250646_a3069760|they got a lot of support because they had that medal.
1584545_a2284482|on saturday/
1413703_a2325863|we are done!
1176566_a1706178|nowadays every group manages themselves.
1183203_a3180273|yes.
1247205_a2238612|nah! it was about 20 euros back then, i mean, 20 dm.
1204191_a2784405|the teachers just knew that i didn‘t understand a thing.
1212611_a2785952|i signed “mom“ like this and “dad“ like that.
1582654_a2659396|i have to bear it then.
1419370_a3324372|when i wasn’t able to concentrate on the interpreter anymore, i would simply talk to one of the two, then to the other.
1418858_a2932568|that means the culture festival in altmark went well, too.
1250646_a3006485|then i went home and sat down until suddenly the bell flashed.
1245390_a2782909|may i keep talking about that? shortly, okay.
1210825_a3201465|time went by, and i had to do practical training.
1176624_a2880884|good.
1246681_a3257279|yes.
1248862_a2786204|when i got home from essen, i saw the report and asked what it was.
1292125_a2064719|then someone came out of the lunar module and took another step.
1249965-15581230-16013736_a3136036|this first layer is then put to the side.
1583322-12534537-13002913_a2517722|after the war, the country was occupied by the gdr for 40 years.
1419370_a3319727|i don’t really know about communication assistants.
1204694_a2790632|exhausting.
1212176_a2779033|i was glad to get the input.
1289793_a2958764|yes.
1291243_a2381243|i don’t have anything fancy.
1204191_a2788467|she was in sixth or seventh grade.
1429310_a2267467|that's the way it was back then.
1414123_a2767706|they, too, only used spoken language in vocational school.
1212218_a2935396|i think, it reaches about thirty or forty meters into the structure.
1432043_a2966961|would we be able to do it before the water came?
1250279_a2941068|i’ll sign that i want to cancel my appointment and whether i could come the next day at 2 pm.
1245820_a2970884|the money will be split among the master and the apprentice.
1206010_a2496688|i told him that i'd wished for him to be deaf for a month just to know what it feels like.
1291243_a2379260|the white ring representative held the presentation, they were also a volunteer.
1583882_a2857475|there you should better go back to using mms and sms.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2904065|i peeked through the keyhole.
1430396_a3267970|but it is hard, though, german/
1428905_a2864245|there you go.
1290996-15110219-15155045_a2099968|i don't know. i don't know more about it.
1183846_a2865173|yes! so anyway, i tried in “blue” to/
1249951_a2766700|i've been there before. yet i've always missed the snow.
1582654_a3102006|as well as biology and chemistry.
1176407_a2882865|and you are inside that building, in that heat, and you just can't get outside.
1585089_a3085808|you‘ve seen him before, haven‘t you?
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2886840|that way you can get used to hearing.
1204691_a2803920|yes.
1430592_a2899343|i was used to that.
1419610-11552205-12003930_a3402054|the second exercise was about slapping one another.
1205168_a2741337|what was the name of the place again?
1414503_a3214736|she was in the middle of treating a man.
1178347_a2898762|poor diana, she suffered a lot.
1205821_a2492272|she escaped later.
1176846_a2884274|you'll just go to the administration and try it there.
1247205_a2239210|when i saw it, i was shocked and thought that it was unbelievable. i thought of it when hearing your story.
1246329_a2756051|my father had a good life, riding his horse through the woods.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2819701|but sometimes, the doctors say ‘yes‘, just so they can get the money from the health insurance. they’re greedy.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2282999|no.
1289462_a2397614|it clearly is a bad excuse.
1429781-13002707-13070302_a2366288|yes.
1582654_a3115410|it‘s a television tower, not a skyscraper.
1177292_a2198952|some of them told stories creatively, others chose fictional narratives, wait no, rather/
1181011_a2012362|he worked side by side with black people. what was their problem?
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3157183|it‘s nice and warm.
1583950_a3282468|all of them say that it’s not them.
1419265_a2967212|once she’s with him, there are a couple of disappointments for her.
1433543_a2998124|yes, one can see masses of people.
1431896_a3002754|in your case, the communication with your colleague works but that can be different.
1246329_a2763416|i couldn't remember a thing and then suffered from meningitis.
1182062_a2773152|he tried to explain to me that i should calm down.
1204191_a2784310|i only came home for my summer break.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2804904|life will change abruptly.
1289793_a2943192|that’s typical i guess.
1177702_a2868117|great!
1427810_a3024605|she can call her mother.
1178939_a3036835|that way each city would have one school for deaf students.
1205821_a2504717|so that means people who had tried to flee were severely targeted?
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2001991|so we walked there in circles, two by two.
1177918_a2879780|horrible.
1428805_a2980954|i think, sports and ones health are connected.
1180556_a2613517|america is another thing, but they tend to understand the topic of the climate better.
1179224_a3257263|it’s quite interesting if you’re taking a look at germany.
1248862_a2782393|the way of communication is different, yes.
1249280-16043122-16070610_a3190861|i then transfer the plant into a pot that’s a little bigger.
1210997_a2734651|
1428225_a2157670|that is why there are often problems.
1291892_a2074239|it was because of the strong earthquake.
1249620_a2642593|my family was pushed towards ‚hearing‘.
1183426_a3636353|i used only a little/
1180097_a1682198|i have an 01 written on it, for the need of my glasses, therefore i have to wear my glasses. 02 stands for the hearing aid.
1428225_a2157123|i used to accompany him to soccer games. the longer we were a couple, the more often i went with him.
1176846_a2894013|
1249376_a2843136|sure.
1178347_a2906907|that must have been a very painful time for her.
1433655_a2208245|i just dropped off the kids.
1583964_a2030389|you could see the mud on the walls of the houses at half height.
1205503_a2777309|in cases like that i'd break off contact quickly.
1413251_a3029400|yes, giving and taking is the best way to do it.
1433543_a2983278|the may festival is more important - it doesn’t exist anywhere else in germany.
1430328_a2178670|there is also another starred chef at the restaurant “schloss.”
1205951_a3114099|if it’s warm, i don’t really need a jacket.
1432043_a2962271|in hamar we visited everything and then drove back.
1245390_a2774226|i answered that it was #name2.
1184536_a2406005|how’s that supposed to work?
1181027_a2169895|it was great.
1291636_a3090364|i was scared in the beginning, but one gets used to it after a while.
1183426_a2788228|he was afraid of being alone.
1209910_a2996097|in bremen i played basketball.
1292545_a2517766|he works for bethel institution.
1432043_a3030141|it really is pretty.
1289462_a2876441|who knows.
1433543_a3025476|in the open beer gardens, one is allowed to bring one’s own food.
1181011_a2144093|i think they have a four-year-term in america.
1177918_a2879742|back then the u.s. copied germany in terms of their development of nuclear energy because they invented it originally.
1178939_a3041093|or when i privately go to my bank, i need an interpreter, too.
1176624_a2880417|i took the rabbit out of the oven and it smelled amazing. so it should taste great as well.
1210825_a3263018|they left me in the dark because they didn’t want to unsettle me.
1429064_a3080583|we went on a group bus trip to italy.
1291636_a3085374|the policeman said, “oh, alright.
1583322-12534537-13002913_a2517849|so many buildings in the gdr were dirty and dark grey.
1210997_a2737732|i didn't go to any other presentation.
1184089_a2760551|i am 100% certain.
1210208_a2795318|people were running everywhere, rejoiced and hugged each other.
1209077_a2250054|
1413703_a3521883|i/
1184536_a2432688|it needs to be real.
1211283_a2769215|there is no other way.
1419118_a3086895|through the binoculars the cat doesn't see a residential house but rather a huge hotel.
1250279_a3102934|with my family doctor, it would sometimes work pretty well.
1246772_a2387452|i held my talk in july.
1211283_a2769221|exactly.
1432043_a2962176|we did that together with other deaf people.
1291892_a2156880|you can learn from your mistakes and improve things.
1431896_a2979804|should we talk about the same topic as that discussed in the video or pick another topic?
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2002001|so we walked around the schoolyard keeping silent.
1250972_a2771074|i am not wearing glasses at the moment.
1212402_a2739556|some time later, i noticed that two boys were being bullies.
1250721_a3284107|once, we snatched a cane from a grandmother and used it to play polo or hockey on our roller skates.
1292086_a2484775|it's like an encyclopedia.
1177292_a2278168|they showed that using signs can convey the same things as a singing voice for hearing people.
1177860_a3203073|”and if there’s an attack or an earthquake, what then?”
1210825_a3187967|metal just wasn’t for me.
1414563_a3096716|i only did manual work during my time in prison.
1418903_a2897365|one or two days before he died i had seen him totally alive.
1419265_a2974133|i think there are many who are affected.
1177640_a3080900|he just gets onto the bike first and then lifts the basket of pears onto the front of the bicycle.
1181455_a2315288|it's expensive, so you have to keep a balance.
1245462_a2372025|but my parents don't understand them and then ask me what the new signs mean.
1184749_a2766579|it was a shock for my mother.
1584411_a2129051|my boss asked, “what overtime?” “well, the overtime i‘ve been working for you, which is why i want to take comp time.”
1184749_a2779220|ah yes, it has something to do with someone passing it on like that.
1187152_a3074097|i want to get my hair dyed so you can’t see the grey anymore, and i also want my curls to be fixed.
1427725_a2098943|
1178939_a3040448|primary and secondary schools are supposed to merge.
1291892_a2030237|but the rest is still alive.
1248862_a2788028|i told my mother that i wanted to sleep.
1419265_a2974085|and as the woman exists the café, the other woman follows her, until it gets noticeable.
1245597_a3080208|they need emergency accommodation.
1583950_a3259038|our bowling club is a leisure club. the sports association also has a bowling department.
1181159_a3225105|life at boarding school is worse, but maybe, that’s a matter of taste.
1430328_a2178708|one week for the perfumery?
1179868_a2559763|in the past, i had always only seen small hailstones.
1428038_a2159941|and on the other hand, that people claimed the moon landing was real, but actually it is not true.
1413251_a3028424|there’s the youth which needs to be pushed and supported.
1212176_a2751785|we discuss buddhism, and all sorts of other topics.
1220195_a2042875|he said it was ok, and that he was able to hear something, but speaking didn't go so well.
1432043_a2962405|and then you go back.
1205503_a2767851|i wouldn't have gotten this reaction if i'd only casually indicated that he should go to the first floor.
1178364_a2882761|that's just stupid.
1245462_a2372564|they were very interested and wanted to know what the signs mean.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2883937|i haven’t experienced a lot of that.
1209910_a2860045|no idea.
1245154-15360102-15384713_a3075053|but i don’t dice them, just roughly chop them up.
1430590_a2259069|it was good.
1585089_a2475058|they’re joining.
1176624_a2880430|i was very happy because i had cooked such a dish by myself for the first time.
1180254_a2175668|we would just write page after page.
1183846_a2865008|so for instance, the emotional world and the suffering of deaf people.
1212402_a2772284|he took me to the car and told me that i should try to lie down.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2300902|even when i got home i kept walking crouched. i really needed to consciously straighten my upper body.
1210825_a3189580|the person from the health department also congratulated me and asked about my hearing status.
1179868_a2587803|a ship goes to sea and the people feel like something's weird.
1582654_a3107772|there are captions all around over there.
1431896_a2984890|um, maybe the fall of the berlin wall.
1210825_a3259204|she noted that she always saw me eating alone.
1419265_a2972009|oh my, you look really shocked.
1212611_a2781580|i was really relieved, because the other group wouldn’t have been as good for me.
1249620_a2599030|they find everything too expensive, and refuse to pay for it.
1584617_a3261875|
1419931_a2342566|weird.
1584198_a3173911|however, she has not gotten any better at speaking.
1212611_a2780662|i learned a lot through that, as well as from my parents.
1180724_a2692692|for a long time there were two gynecologists in my class.
1181602_a3086607|or while playing basketball with the girls/
1245820_a2855419|well, anything concerning the law.
1419931_a2342562|when we arrived, the sun was gone.
1177918_a2893771|just that area around the equator.
1206010_a2496931|take yoga for example: deaf people can't do that.
1176340_a2212300|we are always together.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2300989|that was our vacation. it was nice.
1204694_a2789476|i just talk to people.
1211531_a2046481|they had everything.
1427725_a2700615|
1419607_a3399790|i think the differences are exciting. i like learning and think new signs are fascinating.
1419797_a2742282|what do the hearing people want from me?
1583950_a3259166|we have bowling here.
1180022_a3077104|later, the boy and the dog go to sleep.
1177436_a3140137|but the hearing person, no, the interpreter signs, ”you are affected.”
1177918_a2882550|that's just nature.
1247205_a2238447|but the shock?
1419797_a2742361|i couldn't do it.
1209077_a2255546|i can/
1250279_a2936580|exactly, too few.
1184367_a2568332|i would have watched the movie like stupid and not gotten anything at all.
1183703_a2764632|the people had a lot of advantages.
1183035_a2772548|they broke into someone's motorhome, too, with which they had come to italy.
1582654_a3097632|so, i‘m stuck with that topic.
1582654_a3108314|as soon as you enter, you have to pay.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2894773|in northern schleswig.
1413703_a2323538|just look it up on the internet.
1183703_a2766563|people with money were able to flee the country to switzerland or south america, like chile.
1582439_a2020959|what a shame.
1209910_a3203484|at the basketball championships, the teams can chat amongst each other.
1178939_a3032625|so you think that schools should have integration and bilingualism.
1290754_a3172022|my whole heart is in it.
1178939_a3040401|that’s why they were able to change the laws.
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3033771|nowadays you can sign sewing-machine instead.
2025500_a3266422|i/
1183203_a3899775|that’s where she got her ci.
1212402_a2813762|yes.
1290121_a2767500|i had no clue what that was.
1177278_a2865600|after the second tower had collapsed, we could understand a little better.
1292125_a2729057|how can he see it?
1585453_a1938451|right.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2804776|i don’t mind signing.
1183846_a2864851|when i went to their theater performance, i was amazed!
1428805_a3040894|thereafter referee told me to leave the court.
1251334_a3015944|i don’t have any photos.
1291892_a2154028|when i saw that, i thought i'd rather/
1582399-11073030-11154047_a2738504|my cousin and relatives were surprised that my mother was hearing.
1248090_a2467073|that‘s true.
1180724_a2679727|they were assaulted and bullied, so that they would get a ci and thus there are less and less deaf people.
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3112728|communication goes via a hearing person to another hearing person. this possibility is not available for me for private concerns.
1419931_a2247199|what else should i talk about?
1204691_a2787324|the two governments were in contact.
1419265_a2971961|she takes her child with her.
1177860_a3202888|it’s possible to install them on the walls.
1420216_a2775162|i know about the fall of the berlin wall, but i wasn't there for that either. i was a clueless newborn back then.
1245462_a2382630|that's understandable.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2285838|did you stay somewhere by yourself? oh, sorry, that makes no sense.
1418903_a2896868|i met him and i saw right away that he was an unconventional type and that he dressed accordingly.
1420216_a2762880|must there be a connection to the list on screen?
1181027_a2167305|two people were talking about the beginning of the deaf youth in sign language.
1290126_a3241288|it took ten years.
1247525_a2558320|i don't feel the need to do it.
1184145_a2796580|both flow past bayreuth.
1177640_a3081180|one after another they walk past him.
1431222_a2149748|i don't remember much about cologne, nothing really stuck.
1427725_a2118188|i thought that was strange and told them that/
1249951_a2759321|i no longer have the time to do it.
1432043_a2961913|you don’t even have to drive all the way there.
1430328_a2182087|well, that were the things we did and what they saw.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2958683|and then, suddenly, i was supposed to play. no doubt, i went to the match.
1292545_a2517563|you didn't have to take care of it at all?
1180097_a1707870|my teacher was hearing.
1246681_a3913504|i/
1427810_a2456892|you can.
1177002_a3259338|but with genetics, that question comes up in general.
1210997_a2736657|for the period of four days deaf people from everywhere came to dresden.
1183203_a3150082|i had an idea: i used smarties — those small and colorful sweets sold in tube-like boxes, you know them too.
1181159_a3224091|same - as a child you‘re still so naive.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2888116|that way they could learn both, how to speak and how to sign.
1181027_a2170481|the deaf youth participated in the deaflympics also, but it wasn't really professional.
1432043_a3031107|oh right. you mean lock.
1584545_a2842821|i am not so familiar with the rest of the area.
1179224_a3260613|munich also has a river running through the city, but that’s different.
1419610-11552205-12003930_a3389026|but why is it necessary to be naked? why that?
1291636_a3085483|whenever our neighbors pulled on the rope, we still needed to get dressed. that took some time.
1184536_a2405985|both words differ.
1289793_a2952351|true, it’s outside.
1244796_a2847920|yes, they do, they do but not a lot.
1181159_a3225340|that confused everything; that‘s too bad.
1414312_a2766468|first i did the 400-meters race and then the 800-meters race.
1204691_a2773418|yes, sure, i get it.
1433410_a2382472|it was the same when i got into kindergarten or later into school.
1210825_a3259185|some time earlier, there was a hearing woman as well.
1184756_a3124953|will you be driving to munich on saturday?
1250059_a2481539|i denied it, because i didn't believe it.
1249741_a2774043|there is more, but i can't think of it at the moment.
1177278_a2987747|that's why when i saw the second plane i immediately knew: this must be a terror attack.
1249620_a2689335|when the people understood all that, they can still decide for the ci.
1181011_a2012360|that changed through jfk.
1248090_a2700196|it was her text.
1244796_a2847979|take this sign for example/
1430328_a2175195|it's really typical for my region.
1290754_a3172043|but i told them that i need my boundaries.
1209006_a2699875|if there are deaf people among the group, then they go to the bergfreunde.
1583964_a2022462|so, we then started driving.
1181027_a2165939|yes, 2007.
1582654_a2659361|and then you‘re going to do your presentation on it?
1289462_a2876454|right.
1290996-15110219-15155045_a2075528|i can't say more about those.
1428225_a2158701|i didn't see why i should pay the fee.
1180254_a2177041|well, i lived near my school.
1184756_a3101878|so, i affectedly cheered, “four to one. yeah!”
1246681_a3260898|cologne used to be called colonia.
1427810_a3080117|
1584411_a2040676|dental technology, right?
1187218_a3133259|so, i just wasn’t able to donate blood for four weeks.
1182062_a2778454|i think it’s a very artificial world there.
1413451-11171532-11201836_a2838389|well, actually i haven't experienced anything too sad so far.
1181838_a2774374|i don't know either.
1428472_a3228108|also in frankfurt/
1584198_a3174133|that child is quite smart and is able to read one sentences after the other.
1427368_a3242223|i opened it and saw that it said something about president honecker.
1246772_a2387718|she wanted to support me but she had to organize a lot.
1176846_a2886888|didn't you guys see her panties?
1248400_a2787399|in the end, it doesn't matter.
1247205_a2243830|the legal protection insurance deals with personal matters concerning the car, for example in case of a hit-and-run offense.
1210763_a2728848|it really does look like it‘s in new york.
1184367_a2577085|it used to be embarrassing to be looked at while signing.
1245607_a3080521|she got the passports and got into the bus.
1249620_a2598881|he/she gets hearing aids and will be happy with them.
1180097_a1682175|yes, if you are in a lane for right turns only, you have to turn right.
1583043_a1856234|and the 16 secretaries always held work meetings in the secretary school.
1184145_a2813542|the connections from every direction are very good.
1583882_a2885171|for instance with oovoo, when the quality of the received signal drops, the sign language dialogues are sometimes buffering.
1584198_a3174071|the teacher said that she was making learning progress and was getting better.
1204191_a2816242|he was my best friend.
1414503_a2773441|i still didn’t receive a reply.
1177054_a3050868|one wall would have been enough.
1292458_a2994369|deaf people need contact, of course.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2901260|he had a ci surgery, and removed it later.
1249542_a2768396|when we finished our food, i left with the deaf taiwanese.
1427810_a2456772|we’ll cook it and take it with us of course.
1420216_a2763112|unfortunately.
1413251_a2991523|would that work?
1204191_a2784277|we wore those long robes back then. mine was a bit too long, actually.
1204239_a3066884|what do you think?
1248862_a2783624|
1183203_a3127100|that‘s right, yes.
1585089_a3114446|it’s impossible not to have one.
1212416_a2480484|apparently, that was great.
1183203_a3877997|for example/
1430328_a2174373|there was this one event with all those tents everywhere and a children's program.
1200689_a2169534|people reply, “say that again.“
1244581_a2516279|that's why it wasn't easy to calculate.
1246102_a2817699|now, people sign completely unselfconsciously in public.
1419370_a3319872|then we’re good to go.
1428472_a3228273|it was the same back when i was working with mercedes.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2892998|i was even born deaf.
1428907-11590941-12015445_a2429229|no, it was my mother who used to watch tv in the morning.
1204691_a3910022|also to turkey, romania or croatia.
1248941-12280641-12344740_a2930414|i would feel sorry if he was sad then.
1178347_a2907007|there were many different reactions about the incident.
1205568_a2885511|there was a part in the movie where people had been speaking for a long time.
1179389_a3530527|when the bank borrowed money, they had the advantage of only having to pay low interest for ten years.
1584411_a2071241|that was not possible.
1429964_a2717448|the kids had a couple of problems with each other sometimes.
1244796_a2847932|are you alright with this sign germany-asl?
1184089_a2773017|she had a short life.
1431222_a2129837|that's true.
1431676_a3250619|but do you speak, too, or what do you do?
1179390-14072944-14151525_a2002219|it's like opening scissors. the gap between rich and poor [german technical term: scissors between rich and poor].
1181027_a2170235|we could quickly go over to his office and ask him.
1181397_a2249489|he didn't get to see it.
1429310_a2256704|we thought about it for a moment and then agreed.
1290581_a2954469|true.
1211531_a2046918|there were soldiers everywhere.
1181602_a3094904|most of them knew each other from nuremberg, i was basically the fresh meat.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a2010859|there's no change.
1220195_a2054251|speaking and signing is best.
1250972_a2562830|i signed the contract and turned in the signed copy.
1292458_a2986766|there, paris is the only city of over a million inhabitants.
1184145_a2793443|and in our woods, yes/
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2294291|you throw the ball over and over again, until you reach your final destination.
1184536_a2430084|what would we need them for?
1251334_a3177418|they came in first for all of those events and won six or seven gold medals.
1419931_a2256947|that's the point.
1291636_a3090588|on that day, once again, we all had to go into the bunker.
1583882_a1973120|at her place i saw something and i asked her what it was.
1430832_a2445800|i think, it's a pity.
1431676_a3248832|they get politically involved in the deaf community‘s favor.
1178939_a3035847|i had no idea.
1290581_a2954825|coming back and not being a star here, that’s quite annoying.
1419797_a2742434|communicating with them in sign language is just quick and easy/
1584198_a2659986|they have had that in saxony for much longer.
1184749_a2781020|that's what i wanted.
1184145_a2807718|it looks like a slaughterhouse.
1427725_a2118014|wealthy and american/
1180097_a1707629|i slept for only four hours, and then i had to take my driving test.
1413451-11105600-11163240_a2835202|that's a typical disadvantage of being deaf.
1249951_a2766714|i would have liked it.
1179868_a2587967|there are risks all around the world.
1204691_a2803893|one can understand thomas zander well.
1209746_a2029456|before, i always thought taiwan and thailand were close, but they're really far away from each other.
1430592_a2265652|that was the first sign i learned.
1178939_a2974901|okay.
1209077_a2251639|yes, that's a disadvantage.
1177002_a3252683|of course i can teach that.
1179224_a3257135|i can’t say much about that.
1585089_a3100970|man oh man.
1176407_a2896877|i watched a report that was showing the collapse. yet, it wasn't live.
1431896_a2989285|i thought it was impressive.
2021499_a2597872|they were stuck.
1289462_a2969689|they put wind turbines everywhere.
1246102_a2816389|i managed to get through those two years, but i got a little depressed because i missed being in contact with other deaf people.
1212402_a2750351|my brother was older.
1210156-17573900-18041027_a3231201|i got goose bumps; it was so horrible.
1176566_a1707559|why not?
1200691_a2173157|yes, we use sign language.
1247525_a2531474|i need someone as a partner by my side.
1249741_a2785102|during summer the farmers use the fields to grow corn and crops.
1181027_a2171814|stefan went to gallaudet university, you know, and he experienced lots of new things there.
1431896_a2998211|usually the worth of the money is divided in half.
2021499_a2595609|so i left my tools, went upstairs and turned the tv on.
1249620_a2689255|it’s great if you’re successful.
1212416_a2904811|oh well.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787238|just look around.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787891|back then, i needed my mother.
1209006_a3377020|(())
1177640_a3080913|but suddenly, three other boys, his friends, come past.
1585089_a3083813|he just went on vacation at the baltic sea.
1289793_a2952379|you can also go swimming.
1210156-17573900-18041027_a3230953|to me, it felt like a new life.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767639|it's nice.
1184145_a2810103|money.
1245462_a2296498|it is true that the german sign language is very interesting and there are some pretty funny signs.
1182343_a1851605|what are you supposed to do if you're out of luck and have to work with someone who's lazy?
1984202_a3228939|through the slim pipe, it climbs up, higher and higher.
1177860_a3170258|now that he is retired he is at home with his wife.
1428225_a2157695|then i can just say that i can't hear anything.
1292125_a2065282|those responsible certainly edited the film.
1248090_a2695643|he played for the national team and got sent there.
1289793_a2940702|what else?
1204239_a3078427|oh wow.
1183703_a2765992|kohl was standing alone.
1292458_a3057445|berlin is so diverse, tolerant, fancy.
1245462_a2904909|it's fun to find solutions to problems.
1427368_a3243287|if i ask one and she has no time i have to keep looking.
1291892_a2153981|there were none below; they were all floating on the water surface like ships.
1247199_a2198950|my parents should have done that, too. that would have been a great role model for me.
1183703_a2760990|he has no legs.
1430396_a3267805|that’s where i stayed for a short while.
1429964_a3857387|they don’t check when the next train or bus is going to leave because they're only used to taking the school bus.
1211283_a2769102|nowadays these reunions are nothing special anymore.
1184367_a2600254|i already wondered why it was so famous. the name ‘mona lisa’ is widely known, but i don’t know who that is.
1427368_a3231850|that was asking for trouble.
1584545_a2203066|you can either ride a boat or a rubber raft with six to eight people on it.
1289793_a3030669|what?
1212218_a2990793|like in the gdr?
1432043_a3030393|that’s true.
1584617_a3336745|
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2394429|well, look, in the past, people were used to signing.
1290126_a3240946|the east was different.
1245462_a2296451|they are new signs that i can add to my repertoire like an artist.
1205568_a2880440|and there’s foremen who teach there, as well.“
1419931_a2245746|you have everything there.
1290121_a2457425|i didn't watch them that closely.
1209910_a3032320|they had the same badges to put around your neck.
1430328_a2173903|there was a festival in our region in 2010.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1769802|why did they give up one meeting?
1248090_a2700288|i see.
1183846_a2865002|the play “verkehrte welt” was the first play on stage featuring sign language.
1212176_a2751739|but making an effort to sign/ having a conversation doesn't work very often.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2297702|
1245154-15360102-15384713_a3075105|next, the minced meat gets thrown in, i gently roast it and let it boil in.
1419931_a2250950|they write something down, and you can get in for free.
1431222_a2139709|otherwise they would have to ask everyone personally.
1419370_a3335371|what do you think of me?
1177436_a3017591|that’s interesting.
1184756_a3093453|the food was really good, too.
1413251_a3027358|it’d be better, because the words also have value, i think. that value would be higher.
1251334_a3856903|yes, we received something.
1205503_a2769873|i cannot understand that to this day.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3162074|that‘s right. that‘s it, yes, that‘s right.
1182343_a1851508|as a result, the grades get worse.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2944221|#name8 was supposed to play as central defender. then the coach pointed towards #name6 and said, he should be central defender as well.
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3114768|they said it‘d work well.
1220195_a2060323|everyone said to me, “look at this one, the man with the ci, he's here all by himself.”
1249741_a2794350|in the past, a lot of old buildings were renovated.
1184749_a2782421|“he said yes. is half past four ok?”
1177436_a3141990|that’s right.
1248941-12280641-12344740_a2933613|that's interesting.
1249741_a2773939|there a whole range of events takes place. the program is really diverse.
1289462_a2876456|well.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a3028046|you can add new signs or change them.
1211283_a2766871|because they wanted to chat with one another.
1292545_a2857384|it's done.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2290643|it was really great.
1181397_a2256435|it was incredibly cruel.
1177054_a3050633|this example is narrow but it also applies to broad canals.
1428225_a2157194|deaf culture has to offer everything you can possibly imagine.
1246329_a2764168|when i first went there, i had to cry, because i saw all deaf people signing.
2021499_a2600386|it's so hot; you can't stand still; you have to go upstairs.
1210156-17573900-18041027_a3231121|and then, last minute, i was asked if i wanted to go to the culture days.
1419607_a3407741|but how on earth was i supposed to manage that, i could only look at either my notes or the interpreter and had to switch forth and back between the two all the time.
1427368_a3243188|i always sign with them.
1176846_a2894059|later in the evening, she really wanted to go home because of her cat.
1292768_a2386555|yes.
1248862_a2783927|i honestly hadn’t seen her.
1180097_a1683968|yes, i didn't party the night before either, unlike you, hence it went well. therefore i passed my driving test.
1290581_a2934137|swollen, ouch.
1178939_a3035808|but in terms of numbers, there are so many.
1179389_a3530751|the banks’ money was gone then.
1176566_a1706189|
1182062_a2778565|they also asked how long i was going to stay.
1176340_a2987800|when i sign a lot with my sister he gets especially interested and observes us closely.
1433543_a3031957|the waves are pretty strong all the time.
1427810_a3037228|that way it won’t go bad.
1585453_a1934785|there were, however, many topics offered.
1184089_a2772934|therefore i feel connected to him.
1432043_a3037671|a narrow pathway.
2021499_a2904854|but/
1211515_a3248128|i always thought of all the great things that were waiting for me at home. all right.
1582205_a2040159|some are just keen on the money, you never know.
1184536_a3025906|i wonder why.
1249620_a2644926|okay.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a3914650|
1433410_a2904800|something like that doesn't exist.
1248862_a2784336|so when i get older, my field of vision won‘t get smaller.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805004|but deaf people don’t know if the signal is flashing because the children are crying, or because they’re babbling.
1176407_a2881585|the pilot might have made a mistake while coordinating the plane and accidentally crashed the plane into the tower.
1183035_a2768962|a team of hearing and deaf people organized everything together.
1177918_a2913037|it's thin.
1418858_a2932576|i am happy with that.
1177436_a3131277|i don’t have a lot of experience with that.
1432043_a3042704|normal.
1206010_a2497432|i have to add that i was not able to sign in front of an audience at all back then.
1250279_a2936660|now there are less and less, many leave.
1205699_a3050303|or/
1420216_a2763118|the dm was just a lot cheaper.
2021499_a2614940|but i don't have a solution as to how you do it.
1211283_a2769209|if i am being honest, having a ci means to me that they can hear pretty well and therefore should be in a different division so that they can meet people that are like them.
1249620_a2700520|don’t your parents put you under pressure to hear and speak better?
1432043_a3040729|
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1768471|many are living by themselves.
1178939_a3005861|it’s tough.
1292086_a2485044|that's because i became deaf at the age of three.
1246329_a2757109|there were no cars back then.
1210825_a3267879|i answer that it’s no problem and i’ll just pause the treatment for a bit.
1582654_a3109587|i put on my trousers, and a sweater, and socks; only then i was able to fall asleep.
1177702_a2975728|um.
1245820_a2859153|it's problematic.
1289793_a2952394|exactly, right there.
1428805_a3036288|you were in the hospital because of the achilles tendon.
1179864_a3041871|i think i might be wrong.
1211075_a2910003|no, that didn't exist.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a1984640|hartz iv is a current topic right now.
1427725_a2117948|they focus on communication.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a1996278|ah, ok.
1430396_a3269560|well, in #name1, it was like this:
1582654_a3099907|i had the same three exams.
1205568_a2885066|but in the end, he always/
1209006_a2563838|i always go to the augustiner tent first and then to the löwenbräu tent.
1413925_a2817328|that’s convenient.
1290754_a3172285|through drink sales or gardening.
1428475-13374607-13392508_a3228966|leakage was possible through there.
1414563_a3030606|we were hiding underneath the seats.
2025500_a3264408|i see. how nice! yes, that‘s more important.
1184756_a3077540|yes, there also is a vans shop and a vsc shop right next to it.
1248625-15324720-15465943_a2776724|the little shrimp.
1250279_a2938286|exactly, there’s no problem when writing it down.
1181159_a3258695|there were mentally handicapped people.
1291638_a3101175|the teacher i had was very strict in her education.
1414312_a3911658|yes, i participated in all the cities.
1433410_a2383120|i don't choose it consciously. i rather just communicate with them.
1210997_a2736177|
1205821_a2463638|wouldn't you?
1212402_a2772194|the master craftswoman was surprised.
1211515_a3248214|however, six weeks could get quite tedious as well. to whom was i supposed to talk?
1429781-13002707-13070302_a2842097|that doesn’t exist anymore today.
1292768_a2386606|he then pointed at me and said, “he's deaf.”
1427368_a3242205|i know you always have to consider both sides.
1245820_a2859172|also, there is no trouble at all, because it is clear how much money i have at my disposal.
1413251_a2984707|i mean something like international sign.
1181159_a3225430|i almost had to walk back and forth then, it was approximately ten minutes each way.
1179224_a3274119|without sheep, well, do you know these birch trees?
1184164_a2768357|only hearing people came to the evening events.
1180724_a2678944|if you were to do it the other way around: if you were to focus on spoken language first and want to learn sign language afterwards, i think that is harder.
1206010_a2496848|one cannot see that we are deaf. we look just like hearing people.
1418889_a2707095|well …
1430396_a2580282|soccer?
1205503_a2767455|and everything else is out of the question?
1249951_a2846617|still, it's better to be carefree than to worry about it now.
1431642-17445220-17471818_a3952353|there was a program for the deaf people attending the culture days.
1182343_a1851611|they developed another new concept recently.
1176624_a2886329|we put the pasta in the bowl. after that, we poured the mayonnaise on top, and mixed everything well.
1289793_a2935344|were you there?
1176846_a2884275|yes.
1582439_a2018828|i thought, “what happened to diana?”
1976261_a2854271|everything was always laid-back with my aunt, i was free and not scared at all.
1178133_a2894153|when the flood was about to happen there were warnings.
1292125_a2071294|
1290126_a3195754|russia, america, france and england.
1177436_a3140000|we have to pull the brake.
1430592_a2266501|because i was so bored i read a lot.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1779931|six of them don't have a motorcycle.
2025500_a3264251|that‘s right, there will be so many.
1178939_a3041422|and one can’t just wait calmly, no.
1181397_a2249084|that would be nice.
1210825_a3190317|it was right next to the kindergarten.
1584545_a2843063|he doesn't do that anymore.
1211075_a1977944|when i think about it, i feel very sorry for her children. they were still so young.
1182343_a1856038|it was a pig‘s or cow‘s eye.
1180097_a1707841|normally the guidelines say/
1177860_a3021056|if each window has different measurements/
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787531|now she has no feeling in that area.
1179224_a3274105|the green party said that the sheep destroyed everything.
1245820_a2861907|yes. that'll be expensive – i know.
1211752_a2755335|i would need a class on how to use it first.
1248090_a2700257|later on, right.
1428038_a2864488|think about how many kilometers the moon is away from the earth.
1419370_a3316025|i imagined them doing a good job.
1205503_a2777358|women tend to be people of the emotional type.
1419607_a3414549|of course they have to be supported more during the lessons.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2285667|that cut me to the quick but what can you do.
1210763_a2734265|not bad.
1182517_a2337471|i was the last one. when i had finished, the other pupils had already left the room.
1431896_a2996844|good question.
1247849_a2791582|my parents always talked a lot about jfk’s big family.
1584545_a2239475|the river elbe in saxony/
1177860_a3195810|yes, exactly.
1177002_a3286479|hearing aids on the other hand aren’t covered by health insurance.
1584545_a2284966|one could meet up to drink feuerzangenbowle, for example.
1249951_a2766668|in the city center?
1583214_a1859919|when she couldn't be fined anymore she confessed the whole thing. she was lying the whole time before that.
1182343_a2907060|true.
1429964_a2695461|they said, “poor thing, it should stay home with her parents and not be sent off to boarding school.”
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3114004|well, every child is different.
1583950_a3250713|i worked there, near my home, for half a year, i think, and then i went back to leipzig.
1584411_a2138937|the doctor held him.
1428805_a2980986|do you smoke?
1184089_a2773020|she had a short life.
1204191_a2788509|before that we exclusively had soup.
1429310_a2267469|nowadays it is not as important.
1178939_a3022978|so minimum two, preferably three or four.
1582654_a3102125|i don‘t know what it would be like.
1178939_a3032648|yes, imagine a lot of deaf people now starting to study to become teachers.
1211752_a2747908|additionally, amsterdam is really expensive in the christmas period.
1582205_a2042415|i feel like everyone is equal, i don’t notice anything.
1245462_a2296504|right.
1430590_a2375121|there we saw the older students around us and were pretty impressed.
1419931_a2245708|what else was special at the time when i was growing up?
1419265_a2974071|in any case, she gives him the money.
1246566_a3065159|at work, for example.
1184756_a3142991|i’ll be somewhere else.
1583950_a3250148|i moved to leipzig for an apprenticeship.
1248699_a2758488|it's an advantage for the north, like the north sea or the baltic sea.
1244796_a3079218|no, i’m not.
1583322-12534537-13002913_a2711105|you’re right, that’d be the right thing to do.
1585089_a3085017|and two days later he has trouble with his kidneys, or what?
1289462_a2396264|when we’re at a restaurant, and a hearing person approaches our table, my friend turns on his hearing aids and talks to them.
1430592_a2267895|i thought about how i could do that.
1414563_a3021719|was that also in erfurt?
1248090_a2699797|should i go outside and tell him to come back in?
1182801_a1943849|in my savings account.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2815193|sadly, i can only go home once a month, but i’d prefer to lead a life in which i can understand things better.
1249951_a2766855|nope, nienhagen.
1413485_a2130034|that is a good question.
1179389_a3530591|workers, regular employees and managers are ranked differently.
1430590_a2262024|for me it was sad that my father died so early.
1427725_a2098767|it looked beautiful of course.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2885625|i’m not really in favor.
1431690_a2172917|it can happen everywhere.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2808954|and the hearing teachers, do they know sign language or not?
1432043_a2966846|if it’s hot, everybody goes up to the coast to swim.
1176846_a2890702|oh i see, you were sick.
1187152_a3074081|so you’ll come to mine?
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2819053|at school, everyday life is a part of it as well.
1292458_a3031820|it went well, he governed well and was engaged in everything.
1429737_a2787231|well, because you had to kneel down a lot.
1176340_a2367468|i can learn from thing like this and do better the next time.
1432043_a2966834|everything was packed, i barely could get through.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787890|i needed my mother.
1248699_a2756422|going east, the number decreases.
1250721_a3347057|the commission was located in neubrandenburg.
1419607_a3407679|it would be better if a deaf teacher were signing.
1184749_a2782619|we then started walking.
1419797_a2745817|if i had to sing or if the audience consisted mainly of deaf people, i couldn't do that, i would run for the hills.
1184756_a3101533|i asked her what they were doing at the airport.
1427810_a3026488|they were packed up in cartons.
1582205_a2905190|hm.
1584198_a3179697|machines are expensive and i do not get anything.
1211752_a2752696|what do you mean with ‘a‘?
1414312_a2777990|my wife and our child will go there.
1184145_a2813371|it is the same during fall; it is already too cold by then.
1431982_a3078387|the dad chooses a tree and starts to cut it down with an axe.
1584411_a2138881|one month after we had been discharged from hospital, we went to the hospital/
1290754_a3172258|the deaf community center was built here, a big house.
1205168_a2738599|germany versus italy. i still remember the time we went out to buy a tv.
1247525_a2528918|i also do gymnastics.
1420216_a2774977|just like on tv.
1428805_a2980936|you mean from eating?
1204877_a2939664|yes, it definitely helped.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a3113855|so, there is that other group of children with learning or mental disabilities.
1584617_a3269201|
1431690_a2142422|i watched it, but couldn't quite imagine everything.
1429964_a2203978|he was four when his mother died.
1182801_a1944136|exactly.
1248400_a2744830|they passed on the position from generation to generation in a similar manner.
1180025_a3077306|the boy falls and painfully lands on his head.
1181455_a2296845|dentists, doctors if you have headaches, whatever your disease, you can find every kind of doctor there.
1205568_a2779368|deep inside, i was/
1212176_a2779181|my grandmother loved those tiny thin romantic novels.
1430628_a2126641|i'd rather just continue to watch the soccer game.
1206010_a2496991|even though we don't understand the culture of the hearing people to its full extent, we can empathize with it pretty well.
1250059_a2518471|to be able to punish that person, they just said that they had gotten into a fight. they put a cast on the person as evidence.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a3054101|i don’t think so.
1248862_a2780997|the play ‘rosana‘ was incredible.
1290581_a2938093|but of course it’s different, being in the stadiums at the different events and experiencing the people.
1414123_a2755351|back then i didn't have time for anything else. doing sports was everything to me.
1433543_a2997978|the biggest beer garden is the one in the english garden, i think.
1220195_a2048162|my mother said, “nonsense! that can't be true. where are the statistics?”
1583964_a2021491|oh well. still, i was a bit mad, because i didn't want to mop the floor from morning to night.
1200689_a2169540|in that case, i want these people to speak for themselves.
1290754_a3173427|we were lucky.
1584617_a3272426|
1211752_a2934242|everyone told me that i should calm down.
1210825_a3258902|i said that i kept missing all the latin terms in school.
1176407_a2884931|it's very contrastive now because of those new buildings.
1248862_a2782181|he says it was a great experience.
1290126_a3238848|one did not have any disadvantages because of it/
1184145_a2807696|
1428805_a3043855|but boy was i wrong, the hand has many nerves spreading all across the palm.
1204191_a2784299|i went to a kindergarten for hearing children.
1413485_a2142069|well yeah, there are other countries with kings as well.
1246329_a2769331|ah, he was still alive then.
1419370_a3283933|that was funny.
1248400_a2750427|then the situation concerning equal rights would be better.
1205568_a2810561|i wanted to work for the bundesbahn, but my brother said, “you’re crazy, you can’t hear and won’t understand anything.“
1292086_a2484676|yes, all by myself.
1178939_a3036836|that school would then be considered an integration school.
1205503_a2774513|their mind tells them clearly what they have to do.
1177002_a3253092|my son is hearing and they speak to him.
1176624_a2886339|i told him that i'm not usually preparing it for that many people.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a2471105|yes.
1245820_a2865823|yes, sure.
1248699_a2740013|so the planes crashed into the towers, which was bad.
1205168_a3899783|i'm not quite sure right now, against italy/
1212416_a2559964|i read the article that explained everything.
1430590_a2261931|like that.
1178364_a2887221|no, i do have a child and need to look after it.
1250059_a2478753|they said that the people working for the stasi were wearing normal clothes, just like me.
1211075_a1976908|it was terrible.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3151228|let‘s see how they teach knitting, how they explain the learning process.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2895871|it was good to have other students at my side.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805157|oh well, i didn’t care.
1414503_a2771576|i don’t know about that.
1182062_a2775439|that's hamburg — always windy there.
1428038_a2163778|she was sitting in a cab/ no, in a car, and they were driving.
1245820_a2865497|so, they will discuss it going back and forth.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2933539|my hearing neighbors spoke badly about this in the end.
1212218_a2964872|that’s right.
1291243_a3899779|they made a suggestion:
1251334_a3174870|i wasn’t interested in whether party officials were there or who stood up on the podium.
1176407_a2884932|i feel like it just doesn't look right.
1248505_a2742572|i was completely mesmerized when sitting in front of the tv; nothing could distract me.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2393138|there are, however, barriers, for example at work.
1419370_a3324105|at my professional school, everyone was hearing, and i had to watch the interpreter the entire time.
1210156-17573900-18041027_a3231178|she was cleaning and he was the macho.
1418858_a2948273|i just wanted to attend the event.
1179224_a3257120|so, when people from outside the city come to visit, you take them on a tour through hafencity.
1205503_a2738040|the children were supposed to be taken away for their growth.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2813874|it was just like at the cinema, because there were rows of chairs.
1183035_a2770128|it was back in 2001, you know.
1245390_a2774297|but they didn’t sign ‘deutschland‘ like this, but like this: germany-asl.
1248862_a2782889|do you mean the usher-group?
1184089_a2760753|i forgot it a little.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2903894|my daughter also took her nap in the parents’ bedroom.
1429737_a2784601|and then i did ninepin bowling.
1177436_a3017642|they are just like us.
1292545_a2837789|good.
1178133_a2897480|that’s crazy, when you only show yourself behind glass.
1212218_a2940482|do you have to be quick to book?
1250966_a2545283|i also wasn't aware that one wasn't allowed to flee the country.
1205821_a2875890|true.
1250279_a2936574|but there are too few.
1205821_a2504660|then she said she wanted to stay here by all means. she definitely wanted to stay.
1432043_a3031140|and there used to be a trade channel to denmark.
1179224_a3260623|there’s the reeperbahn, the nightlife, the green areas, the alster, what else do we have?
1182062_a2781213|dubai is striving to be the most beautiful place on earth.
1177278_a2865668|it was huge.
1177436_a3194748|they told him it wouldn’t work, and told him to practise a lot more.
1248862_a2782348|it affects older people more often.
1248862_a2788002|he immediately began to film me and i, drowsy as i was, just chuckled.
1246772_a2810430|she teaches on a really high level, which is great.
1431896_a2998194|after the german reunification they supported east germany a lot.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2001831|later, i had to get back to day care and i screamed, raged, and cried.
1433543_a3024126|the hat is green or brown.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2357634|it is only 100 km.
1247835_a2632589|i was all set for that. still, whenever i talked to him and a hearing person came along to approach him, i always had to wait for them to be done.
1292458_a3029035|many of them are more of a special case.
1209077_a2251124|so that the community remains big.
1291572_a3912116|that way i can walk the path with fellow believers and talk about jesus.
1429310_a2256492|i don't know what i should talk about.
1419607_a3399748|i do not need italian then.
1244581_a2515108|i heard that many germans had died. it was terrible.
1210156-17573900-18041027_a3231206|i looked at so many things.
1248699_a2752769|it was like a warning signal that triggered discussions in the german bundestag.
1212611_a2781741|but i didn’t care.
1247205_a2238422|otherwise, i would have written a note and put it behind the windshield wiper, and i would have gone directly to the police office.
1419370_a3321127|do you remember which city it was where they were planning to establish such a university, but dropped it again?
1182801_a1945885|it is really convenient.
1290581_a2937367|it’s not that easy, but that doesn’t matter.
1413251_a2975673|it’s like in america, they also managed to get rid of all the native american languages.
1209910_a3085820|that was good.
1187218_a3191564|that gets compared to the data in your personal blood-donor card.
1178939_a3039062|but now there is an offer like that.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a2471084|four is enough.
1179212_a3857514|but still, three days later, he died.
1249620_a2644921|i’ll watch it.
1413251_a3029685|english, there you go!
1250966_a2903315|yes.
1414503_a2773947|and do you know what they were doing up there?
1209077_a2251736|i/
1430628_a2126333|i bought stuff and prepared the food.
1184536_a2995145|it would be rather irritating.
1418903_a2902202|but i want to say something about the kumpelnest 3000 where gunter once worked.
1583214_a1858806|
1289623_a2537170|the buffet was included in the entrance fee. i didn’t have to pay anything because i was an actress on the show.
1204691_a2847209|now there’s a lot of variety.
1585453_a1936636|sign language/ no, i mean the sign language festival.
1204239_a3070961|my sister is also quite stubborn.
1583882_a1975888|oovoo.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2896173|even after the fall of the wall, many people came to nuremberg.
1181455_a2296841|there are all the stores in sinsheim, too.
1583950_a3282556|i’ve always been told to drink a lot of milk.
1187152_a3074096|i’ll spend two hours at the hairdressers.
1427725_a2099214|they employ more and more people.
1413683_a2563013|the players in your team were really crazy about sports. they went to the training regularly.
1210997_a2738161|too bad that you didn't visit the church's bell tower.
1291572_a2605066|i was surprised, but what can i say.
1182801_a1942215|just imagine, that the banks would take off with your savings.
1429781-13002707-13070302_a2358654|to save money.
1419931_a2315830|yes, she just took off.
1177918_a2875200|you lose all strength and eventually you die.
1181455_a2334025|yes, but capital of what?
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1785738|i also drive the motorcycle together with my girlfriend.
1413451-11105600-11163240_a2856708|they came from everywhere to essen - from hamburg, from munich, or from berlin.
1291243_a2642416|then i went downstairs, but i forgot to take a picture of the substitute toilet.
1176566_a1706073|i would recommend that you do it.
1182062_a2774641|it surely is green.
1183846_a2865146|[she said] you would be able to learn a lot and exchange knowledge, that it’d be great.
1250059_a2478683|yet, the surveillance in berlin was much more strict. that's why they stopped demonstrating there all together.
1177436_a3142022|well, i don’t know about that.
1247205_a2240148|oh, it's approximately 170 euros for the house/
1177054_a3050587|but why are the sides tilted like that?
1205951_a3114104|but before i leave, i check one last time in the mirror whether everything is alright.
1211283_a2769125|i do, yes.
1292458_a3022106|but other than that?
1246329_a2764299|it was used to make copies, as there weren't any copying machines, yet.
1184536_a2479620|if a specific word is used amongst hearing people, the deaf pick it up and sign it the same way.
1212218_a2965210|yes, exactly!
1210206-11564230-11595227_a2779627|and what was that like for the wife?
1211752_a2755565|or do i have to contact a specific person, and if so, who?
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2394699|that way it can improve more and more.
1210825_a2579631|was he hard of hearing himself?
1431676_a3247574|my best friend is turkish, as well.
1429737_a2766347|it was a success.
1414123_a2767089|one should focus on finding one's own path.
1250721_a3332340|i was supposed to be transferred someplace else.
1204691_a2847182|the sisters were weird.
1179224_a3275758|some time ago, they put up lots of sculptures of the hummel-man all over hamburg.
1427725_a2099187|but where do they come from?
1212416_a2480600|i went up to him and he shook my hand.
1187218_a3121991|i wasn’t prepared for it.
1176846_a2891514|i froze.
2021499_a2597946|it's connected to their faith, though.
1250721_a3359063|in winter when it’s snowing and it’s cold outside, there’s nothing going on.
2021499_a2614994|you suffocate.
1290754_a3173367|it’s not that easy.
1413703_a2304769|they played just like you guys did, with #name2‘s specific strategy.
1183703_a2764620|bad, that's true.
1433543_a3023774|if the weather is nice, the atmosphere is overwhelmingly great, but on the weekend, it’s packed.
1585089_a3115600|when refuelling, i don’t really think about it.
1427810_a2456871|does #name3 care?
1431277-12422631-12464143_a2471078|was it three years ago?
1204694_a2789653|cousins aren’t together anymore, they’re scattered everywhere.
1176846_a2886873|i was giggling so hard, everyone was laughing.
1210825_a3268868|helping people, giving them advice and explaining to them what is going on really matters to me.
1585453_a2676319|was it in cologne-deutz?
1430628_a2126361|it was so important.
1292086_a2465240|it was all about the pronunciation. the teacher never explained anything by example.
1418889_a2744318|tha’s when i realized that i had to switch my job.
1212402_a2772136|she reminded me of the exam.
2021499_a2597955|they are glad if there is a war, because that way they can praise him.
1200689_a2169566|that's great.
1178147_a2158903|i also really liked the demonstration for subtitles, the way this crowd walked there.
1210763_a2728804|you enter a world that is completely different.
1249376_a2842930|wind turbines, yes.
1291636_a3085324|in an apartment building in the big city of berlin.
1244796_a3078499|if there is no sign for it, they just spell it.
1204891_a2758031|i saw him in berlin in 1995.
1179224_a3260640|during the night of the churches there were all different kinds of faiths present.
1212611_a2785934|sure, i grew up orally.
1584855_a1993158|i thought, "a present?
1582654_a3109842|after a while, we flew back home.
1419607_a3394656|those children came back, but they slumped around looking like death warmed up.
1181455_a2296852|let me ask you: is sinsheim good for hiking?
1212611_a2777573|but i thought for a long time that i was born deaf.
1431896_a3003318|and what about at the doctor’s/
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2789907|he eats more.
1419797_a2743858|a role model who is part of the deaf community and who is a great person himself, that would be thomas geißler, the teacher, for me.
1429737_a2787217|it happened due to the exertion, because i had given everything.
1184749_a2788222|then she asked if i was deaf.
1582841_a1783853|we told him that the law said so. i knew that from my work for the association.
1245820_a2867617|the un convention, right.
1210825_a3260639|then, my girlfriend approached me and asked me how it went.
1211752_a3276826|one could check out the fireworks from up the mountain.
1292125_a2063478|where else would i get all the information?
1250972_a2771507|currently i am working in the department that is responsible for cleaning the chicken eggs.
1247205_a2239575|right.
2025500_a3266486|i would like to see some new faces, to have a bit of new blood.
1181397_a2260634|i'm glad that everything is over.
1245390_a2782818|after they can be raised orally.
1210206-12000807-12040142_a3126093|how did i learn about it? through/
1184089_a2772872|
1212611_a2781591|everybody accepted me.
1290754_a3172039|everybody knows that i love to help and like to celebrate.
1427810_a2456826|eating the same thing for a week.
1430592_a2267075|i didn’t understand my mother when she spoke.
1250061-12113327-12180631_a2615538|that's why my educator cried that day - she had stood on the rooftop before and was now able to feel empathy for those people.
1187218_a3191679|sitting calmly for five to ten minutes.
1180724_a2678844|that is the same thing with my/
1184749_a2769387|i gave him an alphabet card.
1182343_a1857491|that's why i didn't learn much in physics. i didn't catch a thing.
1292086_a3857050|nevertheless, i was the best in class among all the other hearing people.
1176846_a2893568|i was able to breath normally two days later.
1184145_a2790126|well, one of the biggest.
1200689_a2169535|but they repeat it in the same monotonous voice again.
1429737_a2766507|that's why i had to stop.
1181159_a3217216|did you take the car or the train?
1431277-12504848-12590316_a2471195|right, for example.
1248699_a2756467|wait a minute, you’re right, and i wanted to add something.
1181397_a2252534|it looked absolutely beautiful.
1209077_a2254282|i do think that it’s hard work for one person alone to socialize all the time.
1427810_a2456875|can #name1 deal with it?
1429910-16075041-16115817_a3075818|she told me that i had to go over there.
1246329_a2764167|i first went to this school in the fall of 1948.
1247199_a2209813|kennedy's two younger brothers were killed, as well. one was shot as well, and the other one was killed in a car accident.
1585089_a3838353|yes, the lausitzring.
1246772_a2386979|true, do you remember the 1st of october?
1204694_a2789467|so not that many.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787253|or on folk festivals, where one is unable to smoke, what’s the point of that?
1183035_a2772509|now and then, things got stolen, and our - the tourists' - money was stolen also.
1413485_a2142074|for example in england, sweden, finland and norway.
1292768_a2364074|yes, they were. but i don't remember exactly.
1183917_a2872283|less, maybe around 100,000.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2285868|then i'm able to check off north america off my list.
1211531_a2047337|when the wall fell and everyone was cheering, i cried a little bit to be honest.
1430832_a2450186|it affected me, and i was feeling sympathy towards those who lost him.
1204877_a2951561|in the newspaper i read that there was a job vacancy with siemens in munich.
1184536_a3705407|in germany, you sign farmer.
1419124_a3095541|the cat lifts up curtains and looks for the bird all the while imitating the monkey again.
1433543_a3026729|if one wants to be sure, one has to use organic meat.
1290996-15110219-15155045_a2099871|yes, one daughter/ one son and one daughter.
1181027_a2170255|why?
1183426_a2797126|how did the communication work out? did you understand everything well?
1204191_a2911105|and at night a light supper.
2025500_a3264440|yes, i do.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3270379|one deaf person had houses with pagoda roofs/
1414312_a2772172|i was just as successful doing track and field.
1204191_a2784141|heiligenbronn.
1290126_a3204847|all people living in freedom, germany being united.
1212176_a2751749|i can talk more with my sister.
1210763_a2725704|travelling and vacations have been a hobby of mine for a long time now.
1244796_a2848009|but i didn’t write anything down.
1248699_a2750720|the fourth is still running. they are still trying to secure it.
1430832_a2450013|i heard about it by the deaf person and the spreading news on the internet.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2777461|the boys/
1427810_a2456769|yes, and then we’ll defrost it, cook it again and it tastes fresh.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3151260|i looked at it.
1291572_a2564948|he decided to secede from church.
1181455_a2296289|then in june they put up a new bus stop right across my house.
1420216_a2775207|but they were also lucky since they had a really long roof pitch.
1245820_a2862833|it's a mutual give and take.
1432043_a3031053|it’s well known and has an old town.
1431896_a2984804|that is just outrageous.
1176624_a2880433|i had finally done it.
1177918_a2889352|you were/
1246772_a2388427|i only taught on saturdays.
1432043_a2966811|one of the surfers was so young.
1249620_a2644899|just out of town, it is tricky with the skinheads, though.
1210825_a3259438|i answered that i hadn’t slept a minute.
1582654_a3123754|however, i was told i could not do it because the teacher didn‘t know enough about it.
1433410_a2384885|the child then said: “oh, you can get married.”
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2959601|that’s when he was so disappointed, because he felt like all his teammates were picking on him and criticizing him.
1184749_a2769381|
1183917_a2872884|the people that come to phuket are usually tourists that have booked their flights and hotels ahead.
1291636_a3085429|if the air raid alert went off, our neighbors had to pull on the rope.
1180539_a3023391|but i don’t know for sure.
1419797_a2751042|no, i'm sorry.
1431896_a2989457|a really big sausage.
1585089_a2474987|yes, one after the other.
1210825_a3288736|i already told you about how #name3 came to help me. he also taught me mathematics.
1583882_a1976896|that's whatsapp.
1433543_a3157874|it’s called weihenstephan.
1178939_a3013350|did you get along with the others?
1205168_a2737708|whenever germany was playing, i simply had to go to a public screening.
1178939_a3035234|one has more contacts then.
1211515_a3248664|i watched them, pushed their stroller around. i was always told to take the kids on a walk in the stroller.
1291243_a2379328|so, she got her stack of money and put it in her bag.
1430328_a2174531|but everyone did it anyways.
1248400_a2805792|the nuclear power plants in germany are close to a river and the water of the river has to be purged off the refuse.
1205168_a2737902|one felt betrayed, you felt happy.
1582654_a3103246|i took driving lessons and passed the test before that.
1433410_a2462262|it would be different if schools around the world talked more about the topic disability and deafness.
1248862_a2784067|he came, greeted us and invited us into his room.
1427725_a2113106|
1584617_a3341174|
1182062_a2781149|a hotel is incredibly expensive there.
1431277-12504848-12590316_a2471253|they don‘t. i see.
1419607_a3389417|if i had to see that on myself, it would irritate me.
1427810_a3048620|but now with the girlfriend it’s like he’s not allowed.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2398038|students feel good among peers.
1182801_a1943746|then, i would be insured again, if that's what i wanted.
1177002_a3253103|it’s because of their attitude. it happens automatically.
1181838_a2897881|it’ll probably stay like that.
2021499_a2614852|time is running out until everything crashes down.
1414563_a3030469|all i wanted was freedom, but i was stuck in the german democratic republic, in the east.
1209910_a2860052|i just talked about that. once, in bremen. that was it.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805136|i didn’t know what she wanted.
1418889_a2704483|my parents and my brother are deaf as well.
1178939_a2974981|what do you mean?
1584329-15450503-15475829_a3192012|everything stays in its place and the screws are now loose.
1428472_a3228017|when i left school it was 60 people already and becoming worse.
1584617_a3272470|
1178147_a2713513|suddenly it started to thunder, rain began to fall and lightning struck.
1582439_a2020890|she was very patient.
1180556_a2618227|also/
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1776739|i organize the seniors' meeting on wednesdays.
1205821_a2504733|but they said he wasn't allowed to.
1292458_a2977411|it’s like in the countryside, just areas of land everywhere.”
1430832_a2699918|always sitting in the audience.
1249620_a2618605|is the ci that important?
1583882_a1975812|one can message me when i change my status accordingly.
1584411_a2876674|i went to swimming competitions, big races, mathematical olympiads and so on.
1428475-13374607-13392508_a3256802|yes, they’re losing hair. that’s horrible.
1291572_a2563300|those who belonged to a religion during the war were arrested and imprisoned.
1184749_a2776670|you can exchange signs and learn quickly.
1428225_a2157631|i notice that immediately.
1182062_a2774457|i think it’s okay.
1430328_a2175199|it is similar to a “strammer max” from bavaria.
1432043_a3042876|just down the mountain.
1583950_a3249609|so, about me:
1248862_a2781731|i would recommend you go sometime.
1205951_a3114064|i try to figure out what i could wear.
1428821-16453820-16510849_a3186951|i grab a real, open-end wrench, a number eight, since there are different sizes they come in.
1250646_a3096980|something like that. i don’t know for sure.
1414123_a2766892|there is one in hamburg, munich, and berlin – that's it.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2285635|at that time you were travelling a lot?
1976261_a2854359|i showed her that i am not able to use a telephone.
1244978_a2433229|the lessons were exclusively oral.
1289623_a2537328|it was fun. i was young and i enjoyed it.
1211752_a2745740|rent, admission, one doesn’t have to pay extra for that.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805058|what’s the deal with that?
1212176_a2778983|however, i had to catch up on the electronic stuff in a short period of time.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805074|the hearing and hard of hearing students sometimes give us funny looks.
1583882_a2882529|but my life in the gdr wasn't bad.
1211752_a2750741|riding? yes, i think so.
1289462_a2395642|the teacher organizes it himself, not me.
1414312_a2772080|we communicated a lot more/
1428805_a3226920|exactly.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3169337|then you knit again, go back, cast on, all the way to here.
1245462_a2371992|they are remarkable.
1177702_a2868330|a house there [in the city] is just so incredibly expensive. the prices are just too high.
1585089_a3140800|there is reitzenhain, just below marienberg.
1209910_a3038019|only the basketball games and the track and field events were put on.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2300691|i went to france for my last trip.
1583214_a2696324|she stayed there for quite some time.
1291572_a2615460|the woman listened and saw right through me.
1585089_a3122135|then also the vw motor sports.
1413683_a2561032|i had to choose one out of the ten occupations; i chose to try becoming an upholsterer.
1427368_a3243018|there’s no way around it.
1180724_a2680151|over all i give them a lot of information and tell them especially that sign language is a good thing.
1244978_a2784977|every time someone missed something and i then explained it in sign language, the lesson got delayed.
1289462_a2395992|you can try to prevent it.
1585286_a1926010|it is kind of like losing your home.
1247205_a2239590|that's normal.
1419931_a2315768|oh, many people moved to berlin from out-of-town.
1292768_a2386647|i saw everyone signing all over the place.
1431642-17445220-17471818_a3952395|so, the first took place in hamburg, that i know now, and the second time around, the culture days took place in dresden. the third culture days were held in munich, and now the fourth in cologne.
1246566_a3057353|but the answer would be, “oh leave it, i’ll tell you later!“
1250972_a2562934|during the probation period/ better.
1427810_a3079963|okay.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2814327|white bread.
1210825_a3264314|i’m still very grateful to my father, because what he did turned out to be really valuable. and i say that having done the same job for forty years.
1419370_a3324349|i can’t even imagine being in that room without the two of them, on my own.
1291572_a2693772|then i told him that i would like to see the service signed in that pace and i asked if they could adopt that.
1291572_a2615061|and she told me a lot about religion and jesus.
1179224_a3275571|about poor people - i’ve recently read a newspaper article.
1247849_a2795553|if there were successes, they showed the child publicly, but if it didn’t work out, it was glossed over.
1179224_a3260684|ok, so let me ask you again: you haven’t seen the head of samuel heinicke yet, have you?
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2820505|and then i feel good.
1289462_a2396115|you will get a feel for it.
1247205_a2239216|i was driving casually down that street while being lost in thought, when i got frightened and swerved.
1248505_a2742608|they were always so nosy and were spreading rumors.
1246566_a3056249|i don’t know for how long, a year maybe.
1205568_a2880384|no, that was completely unnecessary.
1183703_a2760837|later the berlin wall fell and it didn't exist anymore.
1584411_a2138934|my son kicked and tried to defend himself, he just panicked.
1247199_a2200638|the book was written back then.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2005643|halle is his hometown.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2905172|but then there are tourists who come to the allgäu to oberstdorf.
1209910_a3217150|if both of those things didn’t exist, i would’ve stayed at home and hadn’t known anything about it.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2290097|i got lucky that everything worked out. one usually can't take that many days off during an apprenticeship.
1179224_a3275415|so that’s right.
1177704-14384449-14403422_a3093682|you light it and then it burns.
1430328_a2178880|and then there is the chocolate museum.
1247835_a2632749|then, the hearing became exhausting to be around.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a2910274|how many?
1431896_a3000225|deaf people need more communication.
1428805_a2981044|so is personal hygiene important to you or could you do without?
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2290526|yes, even twelve meters!
1179390-14072944-14151525_a1996507|would you have a chance to get a job then? most people never do.
1178939_a3041051|if they want something, they can do it.
1176846_a2884735|oh really, they do that? that is funny too.
1184536_a2430196|does everyone, like japan and china, have to give up their writing system?
1585286_a2086134|a pity.
1179224_a3257093|you can’t go in there.
1290126_a3906270|but i don’t know how that worked and what it entailed exactly.
1210997_a2734180|nobody needs a trophy.
1430628_a2126605|
1180097_a2908893|that's how it was.
1204877_a2938421|at first, i was in the deaf sports club and had my friends there, but later i joined the deaf club.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a1997364|it is.
1428805_a3036220|yes, i remember it now, they were trunks of different heights in a row. first their height was increasing then decreasing.
1212218_a3396505|here/
1431224_a2150027|i trained a lot.
1583882_a1976874|i got it for my husband as well.
1289462_a2876427|with you, it’s/
1430592_a2269505|i didn’t manage to finish the orders quickly.
1419370_a3282344|okay, so, i’ve also had a few experiences with interpreters, for example at the job centre and in a lot of other situations.
1220195_a2049776|it sounds like blackmailing, if you don't want to get a ci you have to pay for your hearing aids yourself, and that's expensive.
1582654_a3103199|then came the summer holidays.
1291164_a3110790|i’ve only been there once.
1246772_a2808677|only signs?
1246772_a2808702|i didn't ask that.
1419122_a3094896|the bowling ball now heavily lies in the cat’s belly.
1245154-15360102-15384713_a3074878|bay leaves.
1427810_a3027629|or #name10, one of the two.
1248090_a2467105|yes, i know! it would have been the same for me.
1584545_a2842735|it was usually open april through october.
1204694_a2791026|i used to go to france with my husband, to switzerland.
1249620_a2642583|if everyone wants to do it, you just pick a particular date and go demonstrate.
1433543_a2980880|why was it torn down?
1181159_a3225469|typically, deaf people create one community. excluding a singular person from the group puts everyone on the alert. there was no distance there.
1181027_a2167055|then everyone went home again.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2282854|she got a college degree as well.
1290754_a3171151|i also said yes to that.
1431982_a3078391|the father has finished cutting down the tree.
1419370_a3282376|it was unbelievable!
1427368_a3231933|that’s unfair.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2785882|i mean/
1181602_a3095247|i wasn’t sure if i’d be able to graduate from the technical college like that.
1246566_a3057270|they can understand what deaf people are like.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3290502|i waited till the others arrived and walked around in the meantime.
1184164_a2771329|how old are you now?
1177436_a3166593|i think that’s great.
1205503_a2759132|and if you're not interested, you stay cold.
1430628_a2126502|well, everyone was thrilled and excited.
1582205_a2905167|go there, exactly.
1418858_a2938578|if there is a big event, for instance the youth festival in berlin, i just don’t go.
1210997_a2736492|they organized it themselves.
1245462_a2260921|you can start.
1183703_a2760798|the one with the beard, ulbricht, was gone.
1179224_a3274245|before no-one cared whether everything was surrounded by nothing but concrete.
1178939_a3005942|the sign language class, what was that exactly?
1584411_a2071343|as my husband was unemployed and couldn't find a new job, we finally moved back to leipzig with the whole family.
1204691_a2787294|during my last visit, i saw houses that were still empty.
1250279_a2936883|i’m seriously ill.
1250966_a2552109|and that's it.
1205699_a3050356|that’s possible, too.
1582399-11073030-11154047_a2738050|my mum/
1419931_a2315714|how many percent?
1582205_a2043429|i was supposed to become a pioneer, but we hadn’t received our uniforms, yet.
1245154-15360102-15384713_a3075101|so, i add the sugar and let it boil down.
1179868_a2571085|it happens due to the exhaust fumes and all the perfume we use.
1248941-12280641-12344740_a2933315|that's how i got to know him.
1583322-12534537-13002913_a2537501|only the teachers were horrible.
1427725_a2115387|others should get knocked off of their feet when they see it.
1184089_a2772904|i got that directly from albert schweitzer.
1212176_a2778990|communication didn't work?
1428805_a3037443|when i am dizzy, it is almost impossible for me to lip read or to communicate via writing.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2777460|the girls were great at it.
1251334_a3174833|ah, wait, no, wöller/
1204891_a2759368|a few members of our sign choir “singende hände” [“singing hands”] agreed that we wanted to take a trip to rome at some point, too.
1205503_a2768000|having read the book, i've changed and started to smile friendly at people.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2397918|that's better.
1247849_a2795567|there was also a brother called edward.
1583964_a2021444|there was mud everywhere.
1211515_a3248818|back then in school/
1419607_a3396096|after surgery a huge scar remains on the head.
1248699_a2752868|also in the countryside, where the nuclear waste is stored underground, the local residents who live nearby worry about the waste exploding by accident.
1584545_a2207841|i recently read in the newspaper that they are discussing to take that one down as well.
1244978_a2430780|we, on the other hand, had been to a daycare for the deaf and hadn't thought anything of it.
1290581_a2955069|usually they were fish dishes.
1212218_a2970220|all right.
1178133_a2899821|that was even worse.
1291164_a3117766|i was a good girl.
1180097_a1708976|so we were driving.
1177436_a3017541|two, yes.
1432043_a3030231|that’s true.
1291243_a2379081|180 permanently employed staff members are distributed throughout all of germany.
1427810_a3036790|oh, spaghetti.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2283242|i was really surprised when my parents told me the news.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787519|i feel like people used to smoke everywhere and a lot.
1183203_a3150936|later on, i told the story to my younger sister-in-law. she said, ”yes, she always does that.”
1428905_a2428976|
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3114777|if there are two of them.
1433543_a2998063|and of course, there are sweets.
1584411_a2135761|i would say 36 years, 37, 38?
1178364_a2884406|and there was not enough time to see old friends again.
1431690_a2244967|to be more specific in the old town, a little off the river rhine.
1292458_a2994361|i definitely need some kind of connection.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1776740|kofo [communication panel] is on fridays.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2815106|then you have to study more in the evening.
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3114783|it‘s just like a video conference where you see several people at once.
1585089_a3117033|yes, but it’s also more expensive.
1428225_a2158686|i noticed quite a lot of things.
1428805_a3042320|you didn’t need anesthesia?
1244796_a3084173|just imagine if there were a bunch of deaf-coda students in one class in school.
1428472_a3228387|yes, that is important. computer work is important.
1290581_a2934349|it was really nice.
1427725_a2099160|that's what it's still like now.
1250059_a2521110|if you asked my father, he would never call it an adventure.
1428472_a3228761|i think it will lead to a loss of signs.
1245820_a2868402|i don't know, maybe.
1428907-11590941-12015445_a2430592|it happened because of the paparazzi distracting them.
1431676_a3247202|i was very dedicated to that job, and i really enjoyed my time as youth leader.
1205568_a2810605|i didn’t know what i wanted to work as, yet.
1210763_a2738259|
1290126_a3238671|i’ve never thought about it, but one could abolish it, sure.
2021499_a2600372|some people who ran downstairs during the alarm as fast as they could, made it and survived.
1289462_a2398040|where do you think the waste would go?
1205568_a2884896|mrs #name3 told me there was an opening.
1292770_a2393917|the time between september and christmas was especially hard.
1291572_a2615118|oh well.
1290581_a2954818|they thought, ‘they think that i’m a star, but i’m not.’
1428472_a3228134|everyone needs spoken language and the ability to hear, that’s why so many cis are implanted.
1419931_a2975749|klaistow.
1583043_a2763433|where? wait, was that in oberwiesenthal?
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2813877|back then we only had one television.
1433543_a3031932|the surfers stand on the wave.
1419931_a2315923|the four seasons.
1431896_a3003626|but in cases like yours where you get sick suddenly and you need an interpreter right away, it would probably not work.
1249620_a2942248|but such a small child believes everything and obeys blindly.
1414503_a2934038|i complain that it’d be good if people kept to the agreed times for the appointments.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2273691|i really enjoy it, i am actively engaged and i have enough vacation days.
1414503_a2773573|my brother-in-law completely berated them.
1211752_a2744518|but i could visit you before or after.
1184749_a2769384|one colleague from work knew sign language; he could sign.
1204239_a2623309|yes, yes.
1183917_a2872346|but phi phi was almost hit as badly, the second worst.
1249302_a2535540|i didn’t know where else i could join.
1291638_a3101860|one, miss #name3, knew how to sign.
1177860_a3194362|no, the metal will be reused.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3157913|then continuing with one row after the other/
1585089_a3116833|and a long time ago, at the wall, the border to the gdr/
1290126_a2457388|maybe kicked out is the wrong word.
1246100_a2730517|through a specific color, one could bring attention to its associated culture and further it at the same time.
1183846_a2866737|they invited me to a debate, i mean, to debate it with all the people from the institute.
1249620_a2642584|as long as you need, until they are floundering.
1180254_a2172415|from my home i had to walk only five minutes to get there.
1244796_a3090299|so i substituted those signs that had oral influences.
1585286_a1924343|
1246329_a2763782|when the working time was over, i went back inside.
1246681_a3262675|or one just meets up casually to drink and chat.
1179868_a2571188|water is like/ water can kill me.
1181159_a3225471|no, i lived at the boarding school.
1250721_a3315201|the hearing people were satisfied with me, too.
1250279_a3059270|she works the telephone.
1184536_a2479711|i ask myself, how does that happen?
1178347_a2884381|but later in the hospital, she fought for her live, but unfortunately she didn't make it and died.
1247835_a2604991|that felt weird.
1248862_a2783828|so the eye topic was pushed aside.
1184145_a2813359|it is always on the first saturday.
1177860_a3170266|now her husband is always in her way and interrupting her.
1178939_a3006846|it’s noticeable that people who went to an integration school are more successful in their career.
1177436_a3134440|that’s unfair.
1205503_a2779990|what i still find interesting to this day:
2025500_a3266485|yet, i told the people that i would like to slowly withdraw from the office.
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3033759|my gran signs house woman.
1177918_a2879773|that is the way they tested the nuclear bomb.
1419265_a2971981|i want to talk about judaism.
1429310_a2260855|the referee was deaf by the way.
1177436_a3017544|what’s important is the content.
1178939_a3040768|one thinks, “whatever they can do, i can do, too!”
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2808840|when they say that deaf people are at fault for something, the deaf people are punished.
1250972_a2771395|when everyone is eating, everyone has to be attended to.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2853117|then we went home.
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3010165|granny signs to-bake and i sign to-bake cake.
1249620_a2689331|an explanation of what the procedure entails.
1583882_a2866157|that's important!
1205503_a2771790|his development was completely normal up to a certain age.
1180024_a3077246|he climbs it and sees a bird, an owl, sitting inside a hole in the tree up there.
1182801_a1941808|i don't know anything about the stock exchange.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2907437|and boring.
1418858_a2942620|the hand/
1204694_a2789649|old and young don’t spend much time together anymore.
1220195_a2049846|it differs whether a ci works for you or not.
1246329_a2764237|flags were at half-mast everywhere, only at the school for the deaf it was hoisted at full-mast.
1248505_a2747056|her presence [in media] died down.
1584411_a2147898|but, right, but when he was really little and a child, then it was still cheap.
1583882_a1975064|right, 13 years.
1209077_a2250070|there are some people who went to school with me and now prefer the deaf world.
1432043_a2967737|we were able to continue biking around until the boat left.
1289793_a2940671|i’ve seen it once, that huge factory.
1184145_a2793315|you don’t feel a difference whether you are in germany or in the czech republic.
1246329_a2763954|my father could return home early.
1248862_a2786468|the person that came to perform the surgery was a woman.
1180254_a2176327|somehow it was like a deaf city.
1430396_a3268800|i stayed there until i was six years old.
1245390_a2782817|i said that it was important for children to learn sign language first at a young age, that way, they’d be able to understand better when they get older.
1431224_a2150144|we wore the same national clothing, same pants and shoes.
1428472_a3219218|there’s always protest or something is wrong/
1244978_a2443032|i pretended to know nothing and got up to take a look at the thing: “i see! a fuse is meant to be in there? i didn‘t know.“
1433543_a3025757|sausage used to always be eaten with your hands, but nowadays, people get all posh and use cutlery.
1204694_a2790886|he has an assistant.
1413703_a2315035|they got the gold medal for that. kudos to them.
1290126_a3253989|the state was concerned that they would become a role model for many, and that the people could start acting up, so they kicked them out.
1976261_a2208608|it was said that i was able to speak really well and that they prayed for me.
1430396_a2580284|yes, i know him.
2021499_a2686236|they did so a few times.
1178939_a3023080|because the interpreter would still be there.
1178347_a2898746|yes, but what’s with queen elizabeth?
1247849_a2795203|his father wanted that.
1204891_a3878272|on monday we had some plans.
1220195_a2053355|it's like that everywhere.
1431224_a2150103|the hearing people gave us curious looks because we were treated differently than they were.
1413251_a3027361|the european sign language will grow, and while continuously growing it‘d be cared for from the very beginning.
1432043_a2967784|then you’re standing directly in front of it; those boats sure are big.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2178956|very different landscapes.
1292458_a3029019|it depends on whether one is married and has a family.
1205821_a2492464|the fumes smelled and were pure poison.
1177640_a3080995|the boy with the racket takes the pears back to his friends.
1584411_a2147660|then he fought tooth and nail and we just couldn't calm him down nor hold him.
1419931_a2247073|people there don’t know freezing temperatures.
1430590_a2259288|we eventually had enough and secretly went into our classroom right away and stayed there.
1431896_a2989447|when we stopped at the side of the road for a break all eyes were on us.
1183203_a3878109|yes.
1210763_a2740096|sports is also part of my leisure for me though.
1292770_a2394369|right.
1291636_a3089619|she helped me.
1246329_a2761764|he had everything he needed.
1431224_a2686867|i said, “i know and i have to admit that i regret not going.”
1291638_a2457731|hit on the hands?
1584198_a3176793|it’s the case with too many jobs. actually, it makes me angry.
1427810_a3026514|he’ll come to #name9.
1187218_a3191586|if everything’s alright, you lay your legs up on the day bed.
1250966_a2551173|well, he went to hanover first and then he went to hamburg.
1250279_a2941038|better than nothing.
1431222_a2149663|i gave a lecture at the university of cologne.
1176340_a2279879|and then it stopped altogether. unfortunately that was the end of it.
1180546_a3009710|but this kind of helmet should not be used for riding a motorcycle; they are not solid enough.
1245390_a2782916|it’s approximately 100km from san francisco.
1179224_a3257186|it’s all duty-free. the load could easily be transferred to the warehouses with a peg on a pull rope.
1292545_a2558345|i don't know: the parents might be a problem.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2885702|if they want to bring everyone together, maybe only the germans will come here.
1413251_a3027381|who would subsidize it?
1246772_a2387165|i told her that there is an educational program for german sign language teachers.
1584198_a3179676|but that is interesting.
1180556_a2678355|
1181602_a3096343|as more deaf people moved into the rooming house, i wanted to live together with them.
1430590_a2261993|it's good.
1184749_a2779262|a misunderstanding.
1248625-15324720-15465943_a2782368|
1429310_a2256437|but it went well.
1205568_a2779596|being hit, that was just unacceptable.
1433543_a2981089|there are so many visitors. they can afford raising the prices.
1418889_a2759077|more and more things came together. thus, i was under immense psychological pressure. at some point i was just finished.
1431896_a2980766|but i’m worried for often a cochlear implant is being implanted right away.
1249542_a2767283|the woman sitting opposite her was an american.
1246329_a2764200|that's how it was. but let’s drop the subject.
1220195_a2042752|well, everyone's different.
1291572_a2693750|that bores me.
1220195_a2060319|i was there, too. many people came, there was a lot going on.
1429781-13002707-13070302_a2365865|one can talk a lot with a computer.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3260691|going to taipei was the first time i ever travelled by plane.
1290581_a2933619|yes, i saw that on facebook, it was very interesting.
1431224_a2150109|we were treated as if we were the ‘angels from germany’.
1182062_a2773175|the water didn’t break.
1178939_a3041054|recently i learned about an advertisement poster.
1246772_a2837008|i still worked at the vhs [adult evening classes] at mkt in hoffenheim.
1432043_a2961924|there’s loads of events.
1420216_a2742678|but most of the time we watched it on tv.
1212611_a2781589|the others tried to speak slowly and use gestures to support what was said, so the communication worked well.
1250721_a3108407|did you go to the school for the deaf or the school for the #hard of hearing in name1?
1245356_a2773657|we only had a low budget for my birthday party.
1431896_a3003708|
1428905_a2428965|it really got to me, yes.
1177860_a3021158|but we/ we/ we should also get lower wages.
1182135_a2750601|the deaf association is called “breisgau-perle freiburg”.
2025500_a3264447|i, too, would refuse to accept uwe as first chairperson.
1204191_a2787069|i went to school in neckargemünd near heidelberg.
1205503_a2769648|then i forget to water and to take care of my plants and then they die.
1414563_a3902570|but what was the fourth job?
1178147_a2876075|yes.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2208931|the cathedral is located next to it.
1583882_a1974946|nowadays they are nice and small.
1212176_a2751865|she became my stepmother.
1291164_a3117757|no, not at all.
1248090_a2695646|it‘s true! he was sent to new zealand.
1246100_a2746122|i was especially moved by the fact that their deafness wasn’t of importance to them.
1583950_a3258072|so, our child was the only one, and my husband wanted to have another child.
1249741_a2770973|you can play paintball very close by.
1431222_a2183379|but those awards and the ceremonies are a symbol of respect and a lot of/
1182062_a2781241|i've seen it happening; it’s so sad.
1177860_a3146249|i will visit her tomorrow, and then/
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2878762|i am not in favor of having one common sign language in europe.
1182062_a2778518|the sea had clear blue water like in paradise.
1292458_a2457767|in germany? or/
1211515_a3126972|for me/
1183203_a3127087|well, i would assume not.
1211075_a1979018|well, i liked diana.
1583214_a1857021|but i can go by car because i drive past everybody.
1249951_a2764626|warenmünde is located to the right, and wilhelmshöhe to the left.
1184145_a2793199|all kinds of porcelain.
1585453_a1934770|there were many different items on the program.
1413451-11105600-11163240_a2835220|what else is positive or interesting about being deaf?
1204691_a2803906|i say that not everyone is the same, some are, but not everyone.
1248090_a2699653|my girlfriend and i wrote letters to each other in german.
1432043_a3039166|the train/
1428038_a2143611|in the paper, i saw a picture showing the astronaut moving around on the moon.
1212218_a2947002|there/
1249302_a2532783|so, i was there to play ninepins in the south of belgium.
1178939_a3011961|there is a demand for all deaf people to get a ci.
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3112837|if you sign with each other and look at each other/
1183720-17021701-17054739_a2757228|the state didn't subsidize it.
1177702_a2874535|i’d rather have a conversation and all that.
1430592_a2267034|yes, and then.
1585089_a3117191|yes, because of the filters.
1428805_a2984158|it‘s all connected to that one topic.
1433543_a3023947|from munich, for example, or rosenheim or upper bavaria.
1247525_a2558311|and then i say, “well, i’ll go.”
1250279_a2936333|it wasn’t a problem back in the day.
1250721_a3347419|i adjusted it. the v-belt can have some clearance, about two millimetres. but not more, because otherwise it’s too loose.
1184145_a2813478|the snow can’t cross the mountains towards the czech republic.
1584855_a1993432|i want to go there, we need the money."
1418858_a2944240|one should tell them that they don’t have to come in the first place then.
1582654_a3109684|you have germany right there, and then poland, then the ukraine and then white russia, well, belarus.
1427810_a3048673|#name4 and i don’t have a problem with it.
1290581_a2934127|sure, that’s normal, whatever.
1204239_a3088929|especially old people become fewer and fewer in numbers, and most of them just want to talk rather than dance.
1211283_a2769871|well, he just acknowledged it but never came.
1210825_a3265381|when they lie down on the massage bench, you can still see their wheels turning.
1428225_a2158722|a handicapped person lives in the flat beneath us.
1292545_a2517656|how did you feel when all eyes were upon you?
1583882_a1975924|facebook, right.
1211752_a2755480|it’s a bomb, and if we say something negative, it’ll go off.
1290754_a3172268|once everything was done, i would back out again.
1250279_a2940960|but when i get a letter or something similar which i don’t understand, i show it to an interpreter who can then explain it to me.
1177436_a3131738|i’ve always been lucky, i guess.
1413251_a3058313|the german language and dgs should be taught neatly, in full.
1209746_a2017464|the deaflympics.
1176566_a1706123|i could, i.e., help with writing the reports of the trips and travels.
1292458_a2986660|i lived in essen myself until now and it didn’t bother me that there was so much going on.
1413703_a3521936|how unfortunate for them.
1292125_a2065398|hm, it's complicated.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787445|in my hometown, my village, there’s a restaurant which has two areas.
1179868_a2873190|look at me.
1419370_a3348059|i just dropped it.
1184756_a3119199|we hugged, and he said, “four to one. what do you think about that?”
1431896_a2980405|and that is your opinion?
1220195_a2047059|my parents went home.
1290121_a2769378|there were lots and lots of people in the ranks.
1413703_a2310604|doesn‘t matter what happened before. so, the last time you went to the deaflympics was in yugoslavia?
1182062_a2771792|afterpains happen after the second delivery.
1184164_a2771317|and they didn't nominate you? i don't get it.
1247835_a2604954|i just didn't have to.
1428907-11590941-12015445_a2773461|it was serious.
1419265_a2973953|she is unhappy and sad in the relationship but doesn’t talk about it.
1210208_a2796609|the area was so big which is why they only saw him from afar.
1210206-11564230-11595227_a2786704|everyone was saying their condolences because kennedy was incredibly popular with everyone.
1427810_a3056975|but i privately borrow the bus so to say.
1177702_a2871580|when the delivery came, we had to store the kitchen in the stairwell for a while.
1291638_a3101166|we got hit on the hands, or our ears were twisted.
1204239_a2623334|she died this year, yes.
1246100_a2730464|white usually represents peace, like the flag of truce or in relation to weddings.
1182801_a1942230|it worked out well that way.
1248090_a2700236|unfortunately, at the time, i was/
1212416_a2469660|“oh man, get over here and show it to me, i’ll read it myself.”
1248505_a2742590|but then she saw the headlines in the papers and so she started to question what she‘d just said.
1246329_a2762578|alarm.
1429737_a2787140|and then/
1176340_a2174634|we also organized some food for the evening because we already thought about the game and were eager for its start.
1245820_a2868162|it costs about 200 euros - that's not too bad.
1212611_a2781592|i was thankful for that.
1248090_a2700152|well, i think we‘ll get there.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2783836|i’m bored during the breaks.
1431224_a2149991|i trained very hard.
1433543_a2981151|it’s a fairytale castle that incredible amounts of visitors from all over the world come to see.
1211075_a1976893|they showed video clips on tv all day long.
1290754_a2457581|right.
1179868_a2546602|they feel it and bail.
1414312_a2772429|it is hard for us.
1430328_a2181999|is there also one in leverkusen, no, in düsseldorf?
1420216_a2764684|you're right.
1419370_a3283699|or during calls/
1429737_a2766359|yes, you always feel refreshed when you're in the water.
1431642-17445220-17471818_a3952233|man, it was hard to choose. oh well.
1414312_a3914508|at my first deaf sports festival i was doing track and field and water polo.
1291243_a2379112|there aren’t any real rooms.
1206010_a2497487|who is your role model?
1585286_a1925729|our dutch friends also had friends in berlin.
1212611_a2781606|i had also sent my part as an email, to be save.
1181455_a2315304|you sure don't want to make a loss.
1177918_a2913007|right.
1247525_a2531364|i used to be really obsessed with soccer from an early age on.
1433655_a2909414|yes.
1176407_a2881584|when i first saw it, i still thought that it was an accident.
1244581_a2515375|the alarm system/
1210825_a3187373|i really felt something grow in me, because i felt so good.
1183203_a3140173|does an interpreter get everything that is being said in the back, though?
1583950_a3282447|i was worried that having a metal wire or a cable in my leg would make everything worse.
1176407_a2881589|then, my mother told me that there might something be wrong with it.
1244796_a2847967|it’s possible.
1584617_a3269207|
1418858_a2947123|wasn’t this the name sign of that one person from hamburg?
1247641_a2715108|yes, smoking is a stupid thing to do; smoking is like breathing in the smoke, breathing it out, breathing it in, breathing it out.
1181159_a3225301|more spoken language is being used and there are more people who are hard of hearing.
1414123_a2767954|therefore we are still living together to this day.
1585089_a3101929|he scored four goals in four matches.
1183203_a3160757|it is important for the brain to use at least one complete language.
1413251_a3029344|there are families that communicate without mouthing at all.
1182343_a1857482|he liked to tinker about with hearing aids to technologically improve them.
1432043_a3039096|it was stormy and rainy, but i was curious.
1250646_a3099069|they had lots of cars parked there.
1177002_a3259382|after such a diagnosis, one could influence that by deciding for or against pregnancy.
1187218_a3123018|oops, i don’t even know.
1291164_a2457708|#name1 has died.
1212176_a2752313|why/ what my childhood looked like?
1429964_a2259302|the older daughter said that she wanted to know what was being said on tv and that #name2 had an advantage.
1584617_a3264500|
1210825_a3129010|it went on for about two months, and by then the teacher had realised that the two of us just couldn’t make it work.
1177860_a3194326|that will also close.
1180556_a2556119|i once had a problem with my clock, with my alarm clock to be exact. it uses a light, which starts to flash when the alarm is going off.
1290581_a2933673|i couldn’t have sat in the crowded second class for so long, i definitely would’ve been in pain.
1419797_a2670580|no.
1244978_a2433357|i hated those dazzling projected texts.
1289462_a2398002|but we're dealing with atoms.
1177640_a3080982|the boy with the racket is so nice that he picks up the hat and runs over to the other boy to give it to him.
1209309-13425110-13472919_a2790319|it smells clean, all one can smell is beer.
1418889_a2757865|it is a nice job actually and i had fun doing it.
1291572_a2693776|he didn't have an answer to that.
1247525_a2558433|when i was younger i used to train regularly but not anymore, though.
1291638_a3101895|i still knew him, too.
1211283_a2769218|support, support, support!
1414123_a2755372|the time was just different.
1245820_a2859167|it means that i am able to directly make arrangements with the integration office.
1212176_a2779437|i went there for the first time and visited israel.
1210825_a2579634|he was good with the spoken language, so he could read the hearing teacher’s lips.
1251334_a3186553|once you competed with deaf people, that’s where you stayed.
1414503_a2774011|it was my turn, everything was finished up and we went back home.
1289623_a2511257|after we had won the first prize, we didn't win another prize anymore. no, we didn't win anything.
1291164_a3110920|hey, look at me.
1427725_a2116258|the second one is the beauty pageant to become miss international.
1292458_a3024008|i don’t like traveling to the same place all the time.
1176566_a1707562|only deaf people/
1178347_a2907051|of course, the print media wants to sell as many papers as possible. maybe that was the main reason.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2898175|one day/
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3112672|the ‘jva,’ short for ‘jugendausbildung‘ [lit. youth education], has regular meetings.
1178939_a3081708|then everyone is together from the beginning.
1183846_a2864885|i went again and again to watch the play.
1430396_a3268011|that was a long time, but i then got a job.
1292125_a2071821|when i look at the moon, i cannot see what's behind.
1176566_a1707862|i hadn’t decided yet and i told him that i wouldn’t know many people there.
1585089_a3100214|it looked pretty dangerous, both of them charged up like that.
1180092_a3023413|yet, you should be careful not to touch it.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a2471104|although they wear a ci, they are part of the group and use sign language as well.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2902360|she went round the house, and came up to me.
1244796_a3078470|they sign until they stumble across a new word for which there is a new sign.
1244796_a2847990|yes, mum and dad, or like this, dad, dad, grandpa, grandma.
1428225_a2157707|exactly the same.
1184089_a2760599|it happened at the columns.
1431676_a3248780|we want to build bridges in the field of communication.
1248625-15324720-15465943_a2777456|there is that lion statue on the castle square.
1179868_a2571270|and the water rises more and more.
1584198_a3420824|she was supposed to read through all of it, and she did.
1245462_a2319238|we celebrated and drank and the party was a blast.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2942470|you can bring in all these people, and they gather here.
1430628_a2126002|before then, it had always taken place in the city of xanten.
1584545_a2284964|a christmas pyramid. feuerzangenbowle [a traditional german alcoholic drink for which a rum-soaked sugarloaf is set on fire and drips into mulled wine].
1584411_a2876668|then they made various tests and they corrected the data until it finally worked.
1183426_a2785040|the educator didn't believe the story with the hearing guy who had blown smoke in my face. he got me.
1182062_a2772494|getting up early for shopping - i don’t know.
1245356_a2817523|right, that was boring.
1181159_a3225452|i returned the key and left.
1582841_a1783982|as head of the deaf club.
1584855_a1993423|our two children were also there.
1244796_a3082609|and the “p“ had to be articulated harder, and it was accompanied by the movement of the hand.
1290705-16340909-16360503_a3074637|after carefully loosening the screws, the filter needs to be taken out.
1180254_a2175564|that is why i was accustomed to that kind of situation.
1584855_a2011046|my wife, my children and i, we were sitting in the lorry.
1292768_a2365502|i saw everyone's mouths moving.
1184089_a2772885|that is important to me.
1419797_a2742353|i asked her if her family just spoke all the time.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1776745|i go there daily.
1290126_a3233439|i had hoped that the solidarity surcharge would then be abolished again.
1584411_a2072723|first, we were living in rathenow, brandenburg, for 15 years.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2815155|i have to sacrifice my time.
1430590_a2256882|so i was taken on there and stayed until - well, i was also a saleswoman until/
1206010_a2837138|we have that.
1290581_a3060978|when i got home my grandma said to me, “you’ve got a bad sunburn.“
1209006_a2558132|the degeth festival [german sign language theater festival] in 2003.
1289793_a2943097|we’d get up in the morning and go into town to wander around.
1428472_a3227929|the child doesn’t want the ci.
1184749_a2769317|i feel good now and am happy.
1183703_a2523515|true, i had goose bumps as well.
1433543_a3150704|what else?
1290581_a2935265|that’s why/ between november and january, february it’s extremely hot.
1427810_a3044676|i hate technology; i‘d rather take less stuff with us.
1583322-12534537-13002913_a3011396|exactly, they were seperated.
1251334_a3167767|i was selected for shot put, the relay races and discus throwing, right.
1177436_a3131764|still, i have been using interpreters only rarely.
1209910_a3038013|no, the soccer was cancelled.
1182801_a1943848|i saved up some money and put it aside.
1583882_a1976775|nowadays there are so many different ones.
1428038_a2159903|you did research for ten years, i find that interesting.
1184536_a2374786|it depends on the words. for example the words ‘stefan bauer’.
1248090_a2699681|if the movie is a foreign one, captions are always installed.
1178939_a2977904|deaf culture falls by the wayside.
1184367_a2577125|great.
1181455_a2324575|#name1, however, told me they have a new schedule in neckargemünd.
1291164_a3110917|during carnival/
1247641_a2714911|it has nothing to do with the warm feeling you get because of a person.
1184367_a2582879|others don't.
1183720-17021701-17054739_a2757288|the asparagus from the lüneburg heath is delicious.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2814282|it made me want to puke!
1583322-12534537-13002913_a2537377|they are confident.
1414312_a2771622|there were no stands [in the stadiums].
1210825_a3306545|twelve hearing people is better than thirteen.
1419610-11552205-12003930_a3401248|so, that part was easy, and then i asked him whether he could show us any more.
1180724_a2522695|but why? do they really like it themselves? even though/
1181602_a3086656|it was done every two years, taking turns between the hauptschule [type of lower secondary school in germany] and the realschule [type of secondary school in germany].
1290126_a3256917|you know? there’s the austrian border, with hungary on the other side.
1584545_a2284718|we could just travel somewhere to the saxon switzerland or something different.
1178364_a2885324|in march, in march in the theater/
1430328_a2182084|i asked them if the pizza was good and they said it was.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2282628|there are other companies who tell their employees, “you want further education? well, you’ll have to pay for that yourself, because we are not going to.”
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2783748|but deaf people can’t adapt as well to the hearing people.
1583950_a3258074|i didn’t want another child. i thought one was enough.
1292768_a2365627|i didn't know.
1248862_a2784949|she suggested we should directly talk to other people who had usher’s syndrome and had gotten the surgery.
1205568_a2780403|i had never seen anything like it.
1184756_a2458178|it doesn’t really matter.
1413683_a2973295|they had planned everything for a flight. i thought we were just on a trip to berlin.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2208883|yes, osnabrück.
1430832_a2450245|before gunter’s impact on theater, the theater itself was sound asleep.
1178364_a2885095|in cologne there were a lot of overlaps, which wasn't great.
1212218_a2957675|yet, my passport should be all right if its expiry date is in 2012, shouldn’t it?
1177918_a2912999|there/
1584545_a2202884|we went to their museum many times, though less recently lately, because after a while we had enough.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2001994|we weren't allowed to talk.
1583882_a1975061|no, 13 years.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a3054058|yes, right.
1183426_a2788210|when she heard about it, she sent us to wilhelmsdorf.
1289793_a2939330|there’s mostly woods, water.
1414503_a3194383|i don’t know the name.
1183846_a2865179|it was about/ oh, no, this is bad. what was it about? it had something to do with hitler but what was the topic called again?
1212611_a2779129|the teacher forbid the usage of sign language.
1182801_a2714930|and if i run out of money, where would i get if from?
1247525_a2531812|the problem/
1433655_a2208006|we never fight.
1585089_a3098682|friendly, that’s it.
1248699_a2749595|but then so many other things kept adding up — i could flip!
1585453_a1934799|there were many different subjects.
1184089_a2760642|the driver also died?
1432043_a2967710|it was different there.
1250059_a2496792|my father and one of my uncles could hear quite well and were very good at speaking. yet, my other uncle was deaf.
1413925_a2805174|“that person was happy!” they explained.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2285828|i stayed there for three weeks.
1183703_a2765942|i wasn't supposed to talk to them. he stopped me from doing that.
1582654_a3099973|i chose chemistry and religious education.
2025500_a3264417|the third worked for everyone.
1431982_a3078388|the forester starts his way back.
1210825_a3267819|my colleagues will then tell me to drop my treatment and go upstairs.
1246344_a2462464|he held a reception in hanau and did some other things.
1427810_a3056246|yes, you three will drive.
1187154_a3077502|he tosses away his keys and glasses.
1414503_a2774093|i always go to a specific one, because they know about me being deaf.
1289623_a2511219|at the end we celebrated a huge party with loud music, with really loud music.
1249542_a2776886|well, the 4th of july.
1220195_a2054443|the parents think the child hears the beeping, rustling and rattling.
1205699_a3050295|it is important to protect the environment by saving water.
1419931_a2273517|sorry.
1250721_a3315139|that way, i learned speaking better and better over time.
1176624_a2886389|“if you cook it wrong, put in the wrong spices or do something else and it doesn't taste great, we will hang you,” they said.
1291572_a2564659|i didn't know that.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1794357|to a meeting?
1427725_a2120829|you could say that the first two pageants aren’t really that challenging.
1292770_a2914058|he talked to the examiner, and everything turned out well.
1291892_a2157156|they throw stones and everything.
1414312_a2772089|the hungarian team, which was the front-runner, beat us 8:4 in that match.
1584855_a1992152|these are the second, the third kind of bank notes i have got so far.
1247641_a2722994|when you're smoking in the room while i am eating, it doesn't taste good.
1431896_a3010886|you mean if you contact the interpreter to arrange an appointment, for example.
1584545_a2279292|ah, yes, right, no meat.
2025500_a3269115|more than 40/
1418858_a2942676|and at the third or fourth festival i was part of the staff and i was very happy.
1290126_a3218683|i was born after the war. i don’t know anything about all that.
1584198_a3176587|i asked him how he knew how to do that.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a1999181|they get very little money, only three to four euros per hour.
1249620_a2643661|
1248090_a2700265|later on, i realized that i had pushed my family aside.
1431676_a3248648|they talk a lot about faith, emotions, and spirituality at the mosque.
1292086_a2465135|i understood more and more after a while, in first grade, second grade and so on.
1292768_a2386592|i wasn't excited or anything.
1184089_a2760440|later on — i think it was september 7th or 8th — i flew back to germany and read about it.
1430832_a2449770|there are other people who are a bit more reserved.
1433655_a2208228|then, after a few years, it ran low.
1205168_a2847120|but that's it.
1251308-15333326-15350303_a3081945|then she used the mirror.
1245154-15360102-15384713_a3075076|once they’re brown, you add water.
1290126_a2457353|somebody once told me that in the east, it was considered more normal to be deaf.
1584545_a2842661|i am not sure.
1289462_a2969676|it's possibly a psychological task to sign freely.
1290126_a3240902|everywhere? oh, right.
1204239_a3078147|some companies are good-hearted, like daimler-benz for example.
1427368_a3243178|that really sucks.
1433543_a2983158|that’s convenient.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a2699249|you can wrap those wider loops around your neck more than once. it can be nice and warm and stuff.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805073|in our deaf group we sign with each other, have a lot of facial expressions, make jokes and laugh together, we have a strong exchange.
1413683_a2706742|you would have to find one.
1184089_a2772887|anyhow, albert schweitzer is my role model.
1584545_a2284332|yes, in there is mustard in the plum cake.
1413251_a2975617|i can imagine a european sign language being a better solution, it’s just a feeling.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805118|for hard of hearing and hearing people, integration works well.
1182517_a2344018|in winnenden i was free and i was allowed to talk.
1181455_a2315515|but they don't grow their own wine there.
1248862_a2786302|okay, so he tore up the report and then threw it away.
1245462_a2904907|just travelling everything.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2850354|for example, different animals like kangaroos or different kinds of spiders or snakes. we met many new people and many things more.
1247199_a2195601|nope, he said: “ich bin ein berliner.” [i am a berliner.]
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2899542|that's why you have a hole there.
1428225_a2156993|only at school i found a friend who visited me.
1291572_a2663023|no, oneself.
1244978_a2443920|my mother said, “well, i get it, your teacher thinks you watch too many movies on tv.”
1250966_a2545647|my brother told me some things but not a lot.
1291243_a2379088|the city has to pay.
1181838_a2774368|suddenly, the look on his face changed from delighted to petrified.
1984202_a3228949|the cat has just reached the middle of the way up when it gets hit by the ball.
1248505_a2747615|i told #name2 about it and he said, “diana hasn‘t had any peace and quiet.”
1290754_a3172191|i’m happy with that.
1585089_a3096150|but the klitschkos are kind-hearted. they have good hearts.
1433543_a2983166|one can go skiing there.
1585453_a1936489|we met again at the gala evening.
1176340_a2348935|when should the two teams make steps towards each other?
1414503_a2773546|we were on the street.
1247641_a2723196|i tried it myself once back in the day.
1244581_a2515390|the information is transmitted via radio, so that an emergency call can be initiated onshore.
1182343_a1851448|in the past he got a 3 [c] in handicraft, but in arts he got a 1 [a].
1584198_a3176684|when he goes out to party, for example, and drinks too much.
1183720-17021701-17054739_a2757243|and the third time?
1247199_a2209763|the abbreviation ‘mm’ means marilyn monroe.
1584198_a3176529|in the end, the teacher repeated everything again.
1248400_a2751763|yes, of course.
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3052201|what else?
1428805_a3036234|i was able to move my tongue perfectly afterwards.
1290754_a3172050|just judging by my looks.
1180097_a1707648|i was not responsible for what happened next.
1181027_a2170680|the group from berlin with giuseppe giuranna.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a1996705|a euro can be earned on the street with a hat, probably even way more than that.
1187152_a3074492|yes, i have that date in my calendar, as well.
1204691_a2793972|in the/
1177860_a3189962|he is retired, yes.
1178939_a3032646|of course the deaf teacher doesn’t know what’s being said.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805000|just like when speaking, the machine lights up, but the children don’t really cry, they just go blah blah blah.
1419370_a3288835|i tried to explain that it was the interpreter’s signing, not the word itself that i didn’t understand.
1180092_a3023829|well, it smells like/
1177860_a3021146|it’s a financing gap.
1247205_a2240246|you've been contributing to the insurance for a long time now.
1584617_a3343724|
1211752_a3046870|i will probably know in the beginning of december when the appointments are.
1291892_a2156932|in iraq, afghanistan and other countries, the u.s. killed many people, too.
1427810_a2456799|so, i can take a look at the menu.
1183846_a2866738|i was instantly interested that there were these things such as debates and thought to myself that i had to remember the time it would take place.
1177860_a3195686|impossible. at 70/
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3114778|i don‘t think it‘s right to have only one child per class.
1177436_a3149255|right, the content is important.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2950303|there’s a course at the adult education center; you could go there.
1211752_a2744448|whatever, doesn’t matter, the present/
1414312_a2777735|hats off to everyone, they all came.
1212176_a2751547|only by using gestures and words.
1292086_a2480599|that's the problem.
1582841_a1783859|it worked.
1204877_a2942734|when i saw the school there, i thought it was generally interesting and fine.
1582205_a2040179|sometimes the assistant can give me a little advice whereas the interpreter needs to be asked explicitly.
1180092_a3014416|yet, this one here is yellow.
1209006_a2699920|and it's getting more expensive each year.
1210997_a2737832|can you recall whether the construction on that church had been finished yet when the culture days took place?
1187218_a3132402|but if it’s too low, one has to go back home.
1176340_a2187346|but it's always better with an interpreter.
1210825_a3189544|but they demanded that i had to go first.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2777584|it always went uphill for me.
1430592_a2264957|that’s why i became deaf.
1584855_a1993457|i had to clench my teeth and we passed the border.
2021499_a2614855|you go on running. i don't know where.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2777428|i was nine years old.
1583882_a2834187|that was rubbish, too?
1210825_a3201322|i didn’t know how to do it.
1429964_a2201450|i went to work after school.
1249376_a2846000|why isn’t that good?
1432043_a2962321|you can buy homemade honey, homemade liver sausage and many other things.
1177702_a2871875|prices have been rising since the introduction of the euro.
1585089_a3115805|as though i have to check on it 24/7.
1431896_a2999676|dgs is the german abbreviation for german sign language.
1431222_a2791574|yes, that's true.
1220195_a2047161|he said, “if your child were to go to america and came back, it would have to go to a neurology clinic.”
1248699_a2756458|it doesn't seem to be the plan, yet.
1183703_a2765939|my friend #name1 took his belongings and was gone immediately.
1584198_a3280741|children have to be scolded every now and then, that is totally normal.
1204239_a3078562|but she came anyway and i kind of lost my temper.
1176846_a2895684|it was nice.
1246681_a3262694|all my friends tell me i should be a chef.
1291636_a3090634|on the planes, they had cartons in which the bombs were stacked next to one another.
1291638_a3103369|then i had to walk for five minutes to get to school.
1248862_a2784227|my mother turned away, she was close to tears and wanted to compose herself.
1292770_a2386727|there was a teacher from büren.
1176624_a2880391|so i went grocery shopping.
1244742_a2479379|they worked and helped, tidied up and put decorations up.
1250721_a3015811|so, as i’ve already told you, #i was born in name1.
1292086_a2465243|we only articulated. the brain was made to articulate properly and to improve our pronunciation.
1248400_a2781607|in the papers it looks like the greens are a little bit in the lead at the moment.
1584198_a3183632|that is why we were told, ”never again” would they hire a deaf person.
1585089_a3093401|yes?
1984202_a3228954|at the bottom, it rolls directly into a bowling alley.
1179224_a3261392|in north rhine-westphalia, the cities are all grey.
1178347_a2906908|because a mother feels a deep connection to her child, especially after she gives birth.
1209077_a2251768|in ten years we can ask those people what they think about it.
1250646_a3022258|really?
1179224_a3274103|but then they quit doing it.
1419130_a3100112|they did it!
1429964_a2206486|since the third child was so young, it was scared of its deaf sister's voice.
1430396_a3268370|you couldn’t go to the bathroom anymore?
1211752_a2744577|i don’t know if i can manage to do it the weekend of the christmas party, but the other two weekends are free and you could come visit me.
1247205_a2243540|oh well, but you only pay 170 euros, as well.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2178637|the landscape is not strikingly beautiful.
1289462_a2397752|that's how it goes.
1210763_a2729002|there i took the plane to lanzarote and stayed there in a hotel.
1184145_a2810232|you can visit these places, look at everything and even buy stuff.
1413251_a2975681|it’s the main language.
1432043_a3041109|the farmers splash out on the food, they really fill up your plate.
1251308-15333326-15350303_a3081449|that way, they could really talk.
1427368_a3243034|that’s very important.
1431896_a2998188|otherwise we wouldn’t be able to see each other if the wall was still there.
1182801_a1949556|that are around 160 euros per month.
1209910_a3032318|yes, last time i went to hamburg.
1246772_a2388413|it happened right when i started working:
1210997_a2734271|afterwards, we held a huge celebration.
1178939_a3035558|the number of students with cis in the classes is getting higher and higher.
1204891_a2760580|the people were waving at him.
1245820_a2862039|it's as if the equipment of one is better yet the prices are the same. that's weird, isn't it?
1184089_a2760647|i don't remember it exactly.
1419607_a3389359|well, if it were the same everywhere that would be really boring.
1433410_a2384332|everybody asks the same old questions.
1428472_a3228431|well, the ci is simply bad.
1414123_a2767730|everything was going really well.
1292770_a2386792|i was immediately sent to a school for the deaf.
1211752_a2743859|we could also meet up on saturday.
1184756_a3129544|later on, we will go on a hike.
1427368_a3918581|it´s not required, but voluntary.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2394807|but maybe it still sticks with the child anyway.
1428905_a2428991|we missed it.
1248400_a2741406|something like that.
1418858_a2943896|the first time/
1418889_a2757945|yes, but he is not a teacher and thus he doesn't teach.
1250721_a3015842|i was looking for work for three months as well.
1290126_a3230518|back then, in the gdr, young people were supported a lot within a community.
1212218_a2456578|it’s because they pity the deaf people.
1247800_a3077764|on the left side, just on the corner, there’s a pharmacy.
1181159_a3147343|it depended on the students.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2819390|it’s true in a way, but still the deaf people stick together. hard of hearing people are more dissociated.
1432043_a2962148|and there’s a small passage to sweden by boat.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a3914678|i also went to london.
1584545_a2203081|but we kept fighting/
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805014|that’s when i was quiet.
1181602_a3086526|the other three students had hearing parents.
1432043_a3037688|they’re only like/ well, this wide. [referring to the width of the tracks.]
1183203_a3127134|that‘s what kids do.
1292768_a2386655|i saw it and absorbed it over time.
1178364_a2885358|… in kiel.
1246100_a2729030|true, the color vanishes again and again and then reappears somewhere else.
1431896_a3003246|a situation with two hearing people does not work.
1247205_a2239655|then, there was this loud bang when the back view mirrors smashed against each other.
1183703_a2759221|would it ever fall?
1419370_a3321248|why out there, in bad kreuznach?
1182062_a2774483|stupid me.
1246329_a2765896|because of berlin's isolation, transportation expenses were too high.
1184164_a2902510|because/
1428472_a3219000|i don’t know everything, but i know the signs.
1204891_a2760596|but sadly, that didn't work out.
1248862_a2782977|i for example can see very clearly looking straight ahead.
1432043_a3041898|
1427368_a3242687|you can study there for a long time, until you become a professor.
1290121_a2767568|or around '82.
1431690_a2142393|as a young boy i was very curious and watched everything.
1182062_a2772541|i go to wiesloch; there are big stores, too.
1433543_a2983261|traditionally, in july, there’s always/
1429964_a2201469|we deaf people have a good work ethic.
1428225_a2157693|when my husband comes home, he tells me that it is awfully loud in the children's rooms.
1206010_a2496669|i explained to him that it wouldn't work since i couldn't understand anything when everyone is talking around me. i wouldn't understand anything anyway.
1248941-12280641-12344740_a3028599|i couldn't book him, because he was too expensive.
1178939_a3005912|i’d prefer a better exchange happening.
1419607_a3395964|i have noticed that people with cis often seem like they have psychological problems because of that, you just notice that something is not right.
1428475-13374607-13392508_a3228932|i‘m pretty sure that they noticed some radiation after the explosion in ukraine.
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3112696|it‘s very productive to come together as the small group of deaf people that we are.
1292125_a2063532|when i saw the landing, i got it/
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767734|we struggled with so many problems.
1180724_a2692844|also/
1212218_a2958505|there i was supposed to show it.
1413485_a2132292|the big brother is now a married man.
1432043_a2961950|it’s called cod, that fish.
1176624_a2880398|one pack of rabbit.
1433543_a3031938|it‘s due to the currents that move in opposite directions.
1179864_a3033980|
1427725_a2116141|anyway.
1291572_a2563251|so they have these two faiths.
1210825_a2579636|yes, he was late deafened.
1182517_a2335814|therefore, i can't say that it was a good time.
1584545_a2207803|i remember it.
1244796_a3079838|yes, exactly.
1432043_a3030026|nowadays, it’s getting less and less.
1432043_a3031101|again?
1428225_a2158679|really.
1180254_a2177682|and i answer: “nothing! we are just having a conversation here.”
1204239_a2623255|#name29, name27, name7.
1246329_a2763959|
1250279_a2942085|but sure, if there aren’t interpreters, subtitles are better.
1433410_a2385022|at first that threw me off.
1248625-15324720-15465943_a2777421|it’s a carnival of sorts.
1429781-13002707-13070302_a2366338|they prefer to play rummy; it’s easier to keep track of things there.
1246329_a2761923|they got me.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2282635|i got very lucky.
1290121_a2897985|you can watch it in color now and not in black-and-white like before.
1177278_a2865655|for one or two weeks this was everyone's topic to talk about.
1431676_a3247584|that‘s how it went down.
1419607_a3414754|many hearing people do not know anything about deaf people.
1583214_a1856839|right?
1177292_a2710951|we didn‘t know that in the past they ‘signed’ [gebärden] at the schools for the deaf. we knew it as ‘to chat’ [plaudern].
1204239_a3078559|she wanted to visit me.
1247205_a2238639|the mirror - my side mirror - is broken/
1184756_a3118476|i was so drunk because we’d kept on buying each other drinks. that was it for me.
1251334_a3015872|no/
1427368_a3242630|if i were still young, i would go to america to study at gallaudet university.
1245356_a2773473|what do you think?
1177002_a3252774|there are probably ways of turning him deaf all at once.
1187154_a3077589|the light bulb doesn’t flicker anymore.
1248400_a2714074|you could also read the newspaper. there you can also inform yourself about political issues.
1250721_a3332362|i really didn’t need to communicate with these people.
1220195_a2060346|maybe because of his parents or other people.
1419797_a2742288|oh yes, then i get really angry. and when i try to talk, i struggle and i can get only so much across.
1184756_a3048781|it’s so pretty with all those shops along the streets.
1432043_a3042854|no before that.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2819435|when i see that happening, i ask myself what it’ll look like once i leave school.
1249620_a2643712|long hair can hide it, but it’s a problem with short hair.
1419265_a2972794|after a while, he proposed.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a2471130|is your second daughter six years old now?
1414563_a3098039|we spent time together until the evening, it was a great atmosphere and there was a lot of alcohol/
1291572_a2564538|my husband and i wanted to get married and there were so many laws.
1248862_a2786479|don’t do it! the bandage has to stay on for the day.“
1432043_a2961877|it’s beautiful.
1210156-17573900-18041027_a3231187|i turned around because i really was angry.
1181159_a3226735|yes, we were sent to bed around that time.
1181838_a2774246|that tower also collapsed some time later.
1209910_a3217142|that was also because of the participation at the german championships or the sports festivals.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2001388|i was so happy to see them and to be back home.
1204694_a2791101|alright, i think we had a good talk.
1427725_a2097948|that was the so called retro-era.
1432043_a3041124|i rode around there by bike and ended up in a village.
1244581_a2514559|i was at work in the company where i made my apprenticeship.
1182343_a1851522|i am sceptical.
1177918_a2879790|after that they made more and more atomic bombs.
1249376_a2842810|we need more wind turbines.
1187154_a3077603|“what did you give him in return?”, he asks.
1250721_a3252252|in my family, i spoke, then i signed with my friends at school, and at home i spoke again, it was all mixed.
1251334_a3167574|one could look at them and remember, “right, i won that one.”
1583214_a1859082|the cat kept on doing that. he came at the same time every morning/
1211283_a2769116|it was more sincere: you stood opposite one another, hugged each other as a welcome and chatted.
1249620_a2643404|for people who want to know more about sign language it would be best to just try it.
1211515_a3240082|it was the same thing for me.
1431486-12361845-12371628_a3229039|the cat tries it a different way.
1428805_a3036881|ahem, the infusion is for/
1211752_a3046618|but i’d have to think about all of that, it’s too much for me.
1432043_a3039104|it’s coffee with rum.
1584855_a1992123|that wasn't possible in the gdr.
1184756_a3095191|they organized it themselves.
1245390_a2775043|it was in asl.
1584617_a3262002|
1183426_a2788234|he was by my side for about one year.
1429964_a2199229|there just was no such thing.
1178939_a3013371|communication was exhausting.
1177436_a3017670|and we are wondering, because it’s covered by health insurance.
1245356_a2785783|it‘s just that hearing people rather relate to other hearing people.
1181838_a2773339|yes, i still remember that day very well.
1249302_a2535543|at some point i lost interest, so i left it to other people.
1177704-14384449-14403422_a3093692|through the added air, the embers spread out more.
1582205_a2041026|there are people like that, don't you think?
1289623_a2904468|palermo.
1413683_a2563976|even if i am a good soccer player myself, i have to encourage and support my teammates. that's good for the entire team.
1179224_a3271931|the water is from bergedorf and is bottled by the company bismarck, right?
1431224_a2149992|my training was really rigorous.
1177002_a3281832|is it so that the child can be integrated at school, or is it about the future working life, or what?
1584855_a1995086|i'd rather thought of buying them clothes.
1210156-17573900-18041027_a3231217|for example on deaf blindness, identity, then also/ oh, there were so many.
1419370_a3283896|he told me that i shouldn’t masturbate too often, but that i should go easy on my right arm.
1428805_a3040924|but the helpers didn’t change their mind, i had to leave the court.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805135|once during lunch break, a girl approached me as i was just looking around.
1212611_a2786038|i asked myself why that was the case, i was able to decide for myself what i wanted, after all.
1246102_a2815659|my brother?
1433543_a2997863|there are also fairy lights and lanterns to give some light.
1183426_a2797986|after the coffee break i went quickly downstairs to play football.
1209910_a3203486|at the championships, it’s more about the community of all basketball players.
1178939_a3008498|they were somewhat shocked at first.
1431690_a2172800|but i felt sorry for everybody living there.
1181159_a3225163|you didn‘t like the boarding school.
1182062_a2778472|it's really hot there that time of the year.
1583882_a2834140|i have six/ what is it again/
1247849_a2821154|it has to be rebuilt.
1248862_a2783238|back then.
1414123_a2767918|my ex-wife didn't stay in berlin, she moved to potsdam.
1429964_a2204245|but it was really hard on her.
1178939_a2977442|even the hard of hearing people didn’t matter to me.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2418661|i didn't count the amount of times.
1210825_a3128770|which year did you have that interpreter?
1176624_a2880404|i pricked the rabbit a little bit with a fork and then put it into the oven.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2789839|that’s true.
1418858_a2938775|and that automatically guaranteed me a vip pass.
1583214_a1857039|well, they have to rob somebody because they don't have any money.
1210208_a2795339|that’s how i heard about it.
1414563_a3072260|it was an adventurous time.
1413485_a2129900|but now as a grown up i sure know about all this.
1177002_a3259474|of course with artificial insemination, one could maybe request specific things.
1249951_a2761156|now, let spring begin!
1429124-13403249-13545507_a3670689|oh, i see.
1177002_a3259892|but is it the same for deaf people?
1205568_a2883151|close, cooperative teamwork as such didn’t exist anymore.
1249620_a2643544|i want there to be more deaf people just with hearing aids.
1585089_a3120326|it’s an addiction.
1209077_a2249450|a ci is not a fit for everyone.
1179224_a3275587|billstedt is at the top.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2277116|it was my goal to become an assistant tax consultant in the area of customer advisory service.
1181027_a2171811|but i'm not sure.
1290754_a3173293|i got the bravery and resilience through my deaf parents.
2025500_a3273272|i‘m coordinating the department for the regional association.
1248505_a2756297|everyone just keeps on snooping around.
1427725_a2701322|everything is in one color and that's it.
1251334_a3173499|we were selected in a way that would make sense and the team for güstrow was assembled/
1250972_a2771399|three people work at the serving counter, another two in the back and i work at the automatic dishwasher.
1431676_a3247177|it was only later that i realized that my father had done it because he was very proud.
1418858_a2940989|i started to take a look around more closely, and noticed that most deaf people were in a conversation themselves instead of watching what was happening up front.
1212176_a2779195|i took one and was delighted.
1433543_a2983263|there’s the may festival.
1249620_a2643428|and then continue with words.
1584617_a3374412|
1244742_a2481441|so there were less and less people, which was good for us, as we had less to clean up then.
1204691_a2771338|glasses from fielmann [well-known optics company focusing on retail eyewear] and clothes stores from the west came to eastern germany.
1418889_a2757854|you get your hands dirty.
1246772_a2387445|six months.
1414563_a3100139|i see, your parents are also deaf.
1212176_a2751146|we continued, and the red cross warmly welcomed us.
1584617_a3269465|
1249302_a2540041|if you like doing that, go ahead.
1209077_a2249464|if someone's 100% deaf, a ci would be useless, because the cochlear nerve is broken then.
1211283_a2761287|i even lived close by.
1289462_a2398423|we live longer.
1183203_a3127065|i don‘t think so, no, i don‘t believe it!
1220196-12291229-12432115_a2910278|you two?
1430328_a2182168|that's when i saw foxes.
1248941-12280641-12344740_a2929093|sometimes it is exhausting to explain stuff.
1249965-15581230-16013736_a3135996|once i have everything, i go home and get started.
1427368_a3242721|why is it not accepted here in germany?
1419607_a3429051|but this parent was very driven.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787921|that’s what i think.
1212402_a2772115|i already didn't feel good then. i didn't know what was wrong with me.
1177292_a2987605|
1205821_a2492353|one good thing about the gdr was, however, the promotion of children.
1292458_a3023954|i can’t write in german over there.
1432043_a3028383|three, four apprentices from the tsbw husum had a little field work there to repair something.
1204239_a2623304|and the christmas bonus as a pensioner!
1187218_a3191540|after twenty donations you get a free gift such as a watch or a bottle of wine or something else.
1209309-13425110-13472919_a2793216|i know that in munich/
1291572_a2863628|that's the norm.
1429964_a2717428|i only remember things about my mother from a certain age.
1427810_a3041624|we can go to a restaurant on new year’s.
1249951_a2761108|yet, last year we actually had this heavy snowfall.
1289462_a2398344|you'd have to do the dishes yourself.
1180254_a2175979|right, dental technology. we were the first all deaf class.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3280923|it was clean and really bright.
1584617_a3345228|
1177436_a3017661|at the same time, the ci is being used far more widespread; i don’t get it.
1181455_a2324393|not me.
1289793_a2958762|true, there’s a lot of bikes at the train station.
1209746_a2903488|yes.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2908531|i came back, and oh look at that: i’m still alive.
1584855_a1994752|the alternator was also full of oil.
1248400_a2750482|well, we have to fight.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805009|that’s true.
1431690_a2142405|everybody had to shovel sand.
1204877_a2942705|i had cyanosis.
1414123_a2768077|after that i brought my sports career to an end.
1432043_a2961894|true.
1431222_a2139667|you'd only have to come to erfurt and that's it.
1249376_a2843104|today, cars are widely spread, as well as exhaust gases.
1183703_a2764555|i didn't mind and we went there together.
2025500_a3271878|and when asking them whether they receive the ‘pflegegeld’ for the deaf people, they always reply with an eager ‘yes’.
1584545_a2287083|we could have a christmas party with everyone at some point as well.
1211283_a2769195|i have to use lbg [signed german].
1181455_a2302439|i live outside of town.
1178364_a2884399|the talk was just held once and wasn't repeated in the program.
1291892_a2074248|people were sad, as their houses were gone.
1204694_a2790824|that’s good, too.
1585089_a2474932|is that actually that bad?
1248625-15324720-15465943_a2782261|it is unusual to have such a big carnival parade up north, meaning in brunswick.
1245462_a2296471|i think it is very fascinating how new signs develop and how they are created.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2285658|now, with my apprenticeship, that’s gotten less.
1585286_a1924254|dresden, yes.
1247641_a2723163|and then?
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3010157|i sign august, my granny uses a different sign.
1419607_a3403368|when we got off the train in moscow we immediately caught some hearing peoples’ eye.
1427725_a2903748|right.
1181602_a3086390|there were a couple of hard of hearing students whose signing was a bit clumsy, but we always signed.
1176407_a2877862|i can't really say anything about jfk. back then, i wasn't born yet.
1244978_a2443953|i was twelve years old.
1582654_a3103189|yes, i’d rather do it quickly there than doing it here every week.
1290126_a3240732|that was the regulation, that’s how it went.
1244581_a2515115|there was flight trouble, too.
1427725_a2116159|i don't know anything about the history or the origin of beauty pageants, though.
1181838_a2773345|i will never forget how easily something like that can happen.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2402675|so there are less deaf people.
1427368_a3243478|i recommended her to refrain from it.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2002227|but i said no to that, too.
1583882_a2885244|… when one uses a tty, one has to think about which connection is there.
1248862_a2782237|america, slovenia, greece, it differed.
1247849_a2791379|yes, via tv.
1248862_a2782210|if i imagine i had worked for a company, then i could’ve chosen that period of time as my holiday.
1184749_a2766574|nothing had happened, actually.
1248699_a2758532|astonishing.
1291243_a2379070|us deaf people were there in a group of three. right? yes, us three.
1248090_a2695861|at that time, there was a crisis in england.
1419607_a3399192|but/
1187218_a3121769|he wants to help others by doing it, so he always goes to the red cross.
1248699_a2750757|the eastern areas, like thailand, japan, china — those regions are dangerous.
1184756_a3135401|i didn’t want to get sun burned.
1290754_a3172280|i wasn’t sure.
1429964_a2204035|his mother didn't want to abandon them when she got severe pain in her right abdominal region.
1250061-12113327-12180631_a2615976|yet, i do know that bush should have been at the white house.
1245820_a2859166|the integration office changed it, and the former triangle dissolved.
1177436_a3149191|one will tap the other on the knee and point at the watch.
1182517_a2405450|for example - you do know the ping-pong room downstairs, don't you?
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2902241|respect, that’s great.
1178147_a2722936|i wasn't there either.
1583882_a1973098|after the fall of the berlin wall the communication went more smoothly.
1179868_a2556732|the sun was shining when we arrived.
1246100_a2726604|i just moved in the narrow space where i could do everything.
1584545_a2207792|… and i am not sure, foxes/ but once, i don’t remember that anymore/
1220195_a2056258|“i can do absolutely everything”, i said.
1246772_a2387620|in the beginning the grades were said openly.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2394802|it's bad if the parents are hearing.
1246102_a2819349|but i did not expect her to come in first.
1432043_a3042672|i was traveling around a lot.
1583043_a1856131|he had a very stern facial expression.
1584545_a2243293|they have a lot of food booths, it smells wonderful and there is mulled wine.
1244796_a3078438|exactly, that’s not possible.
1431690_a2172886|
1584855_a1994887|next, he was ringing around.
1177002_a3259735|i think the most important point always is for the donor to be healthy.
1431222_a2185091|wasn't it planned to work together?
1427810_a2456668|the doctor/
1176624_a2895822|i cut a lot of food and cooked a huge pot of pasta.
1187218_a3133265|when i finally managed to meet all necessary criteria, i pulled myself together and bravely went to the donation centre.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2819717|some are greedy, that’s true.
1178939_a3007089|but that was it.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805147|“i didn’t know that and i find it very interesting.“
1181159_a3224990|it was a provocation.
1184089_a2773037|but you can say she was a kind woman.
1205821_a2528008|and now he's free.
1584545_a2202728|you have to stop then.
1182062_a2775411|the highway? forget it!
1176624_a2885716|and of course i said yes.
1289462_a2395663|i ask myself — people always have all kinds of new ideas in germany.
1429310_a2261141|i was just relieved.
1184536_a2430192|on the other hand, it’s correct, too.
2025500_a3269591|that‘s right, exactly.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2294289|you take a “bollerwagen” [like a toy wagon] with you - just like you explained, but you also carry along the “boßel-”balls with which you play on the street.
1181159_a3226662|that‘s why my mother tried everything to make an application for one of those small busses of the ‘malteser hilfsdienst’ [catholic aid agency in germany].
1250279_a2937002|yes.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2399906|or a b by holding your hand under your chin.
1183846_a2865135|and that was around the time i joined the “visuelle theater”.
1204877_a2926163|the midwife said that there were complications and that something would stay with me forever, but she didn’t know what.
1430328_a2175005|but i don't know anything about its origin.
1177436_a3166594|but still, focusing on the interpreters so much is quite a task.
1177436_a3017570|no.
1418858_a2933875|oh, for you/
1585089_a3110400|driving a diesel is expensive.
1212176_a2751884|i regretted that after i finished school.
1250972_a2766142|once, i was sick for six weeks because of an accident at work, but that was the only time.
1290121_a2748938|in 1974, germany hosted the fifa world cup for the first time.
1246100_a2730599|but it worked, in the end approximately 1000 people came to the parade.
1289462_a2395545|one was “nuclear power stations” - do you remember?
1585453_a1937735|the sign language festival had started already?
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3014147|i sign lad and gran signs lad, like that.
1181455_a2334172|and the ‘kurhaus’ is so pretty to look at!
1177860_a3203325|for “sehen statt hören”, you need to register with jürgen stachlewitz from munich.
1182062_a2771611|i was fighting for twelve hours.
1418889_a2744103|yes, hm.
1250972_a2501882|but i didn't want to copy her; i wanted to do my own thing.
1220195_a2053413|if/
1432043_a3042899|ah, you’ve been to the bungsberg before.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3289821|we had to walk incredibly far. really, it was unbelievably far. there were these moving walkways going on forever.
1204891_a2759147|how did i hear about it?
1418858_a2949871|i was watching his every move.
1180724_a2680197|it feels like that we need extra care taking and one cannot engage with us normally.
1249376_a2987270|yes, that’s true.
1183703_a2760713|and among deaf people, maybe.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2394859|he uses hearing aids now, which he finds very comfortable.
1204694_a2789646|people used to be in good, intimate families.
1177702_a2868122|i just hadn't thought about it.
1291638_a3101772|he was a member of the nazi party and extremely strict.
1245820_a2855402|yes, anything.
1246344_a2465745|that's it.
1428472_a3228727|they are kind, well raised and nice.
1212218_a2947101|it triggered uncertainty again, and they were supposed to pass on the flight.
1184367_a2903987|right?
1292458_a3025833|right.
1246100_a2746080|and i stayed, although i wasn’t elected, i stayed.
1210208_a2913676|at the election of the pope?
1431277-12422631-12464143_a3114623|i mean that your son started school?
1582439_a2018855|it was like sabotaging.
1584617_a3340718|
1248699_a2750744|i heard about it just recently.
2021499_a2600374|with victims/
1432043_a3040753|kiel is more well-known for herring.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2992857|no, i took the train.
1419265_a2972121|there are so many different ways to propose.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2208854|they discovered some remains of the roman age while doing some archeological excavations.
1200689_a2169532|that was demanding.
1177292_a2199000|did they have to/
1245820_a2865612|i’d rather appoint an interpreter to come to the hospital myself. then the hospital just doesn't notice it.
1584198_a3173989|at home the family does the work of raising the child in their everyday life.
1245820_a2971220|do i send it back to the interpreter?
1178133_a2899855|it was the last place.
1179224_a3257308|you mean around the alster, in poppenbüttel.
1210763_a2739729|and it's healthy.
1418858_a2950827|at some point you need the chance to comment, to talk and if there is no chance to ask questions, you can just forget about it all together.
1418889_a2704523|there were children who were hard of hearing and so i went there to nursery school.
1177436_a3181041|it’s obvious how a hearing family would go about insemination.
1250972_a2941672|i let her be and kept working in the company on my own.
1290581_a2938097|in four years the games will be held in greece.
1428805_a3043835|i thought that that part of the thumb wasn’t that bad.
1291572_a2633939|exactly.
1249376_a2842639|the radiation was everywhere.
1206010_a2491438|how can i put it?
1177860_a3176930|he ordered that window.
1245462_a2904931|oh, i see.
1210156-17573900-18041027_a3231162|alright, enough of that.
1249542_a2938783|you were able to go back and forth between the supermarket and the hotel; that was nice.
1430328_a2182176|yeah, we have a lot of foxes.
1984213_a3229010|there, it gets beat up by the cat, who then puts on the uniform and hat.
1430328_a2179933|i recently visited my cousin.
1582654_a3105697|here in germany our signs vary quite a bit, but over there everyone uses the same signs.
1429310_a2253123|once a year, there was a sports day at my school. that is where we fought to determine the best athlete.
1211752_a2744252|but i already have my company’s christmas party on the 10th of december.
1414312_a2766467|in 1977 i participated in the deaflympics for the first time.
1429781-12565132-12585506_a2358464|but my dad was still in the house.
1248699_a2749718|they discussed it further; it wasn’t that easy.
1184756_a3118392|we said goodbye and went our separate ways.
1204191_a2784490|we were twenty in total.
1290581_a2954800|that’s how they made a lot of money.
1431896_a2999440|what is the difference?
1585089_a3085817|i mean, it was obvious.
1414503_a2778965|i called my neighbor, my other neighbor.
1211075_a1976855|a double with the same hairstyle who was laughing the same way.
1427368_a3231848|when we spoke about it for the first time, we already stated that the government made a big mistake.
1248090_a2699762|she was even willing to do a presentation on it at the kofo [abbreveation for kommunikationsforum, engl. communication forum].
1211752_a2748402|i see, whatever.
1211752_a3052492|we’d go there early and go back home in the evening.
1432043_a3042845|hey.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2804755|you must be talking about the same things all the time.“
1244581_a2515389|the buoys are floating in the water and when the water pushes them up high, people know there's been a quake.
1583950_a3282876|the other three also like rice pudding with milk, but i think it’s disgusting.
1584198_a3183626|the person that used to work there apparently did a really bad job and made many mistakes.
1183203_a3127089|it didn‘t work, so it ended up stashed in a drawer. that way he remained deaf his entire life, but he is happy with it.
1249376_a2842870|you need three, four wind turbines for one village.
1248862_a2783125|that can happen.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2933547|they complained, “hey, why do only hearing people die? it would have been better for the deaf-mute to die.“
1419265_a2973961|the woman is surprised at first.
1178939_a2990489|right.
1584855_a1992104|then i visited the proper department and showed my passport.
1583043_a3913216|that was a little provocative.
1206010_a2729431|everyone said, “no, of course not!”
1248862_a2784250|my mother put it off and sent me to my father.
1431676_a3247356|yet, she always was a bit jealous of me for traveling so much.
1413251_a3028675|at some point, i had to get a new book on a certain topic.
1181838_a2774333|it happened really fast.
1181159_a3281311|i was really furious and pushed him.
1414123_a2768028|i was also an athlete for athletics in cologne.
1432043_a3039092|i did it!
1432043_a2962106|yes.
1251334_a3177421|i only won one.
1181159_a3225393|i forgot to tell you about winnenden.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2785872|but the people are less and less interested in going to bars, so there are less and less people coming.
1209910_a2860018|oh yes, successes.
1176846_a2886996|you can't see her undergarments since everything is dark under there.
1427725_a2115372|
1247205_a2212379|on the phone they said, they didn't need to come.
1177860_a3021177|it was like a cave down there and so he had a little space to move.
1176846_a2886992|the head only goes as far as the garter.
1183426_a2788243|later, we were on our own independent ways.
1428038_a2158589|if they had to do it all over again, they wouldn't make it.
1292458_a3023963|but that’s it.
1182062_a2774454|my daughter says, “you’re crazy strolling through the city that long.“
2025500_a3264415|no, why does it take place on september 3rd?
1289793_a2943175|true.
1585089_a3096920|he, towards the english guy/
1584411_a2147905|no, i think when my son was about five or six years old/
1427810_a3030303|oh, so there’s #name10 and #name11, so two?
1179224_a3260653|did you attend the night of the churches?
1179212_a2880874|something was lacking and i really missed him and the mood that he always used to spread.
1413485_a2130055|i just heard about her death, but i didn't know how it happened.
1180022_a3077081|it’s about a small boy and a dog.
1181455_a2299722|you wrap yourself up in it, and dry yourself.
1180254_a2172194|or even spoken language, orally!
1290126_a3240620|even when there’s something to do in the garden, or just any problems in general.
1250279_a2935585|i always take interpreters with me to assemblies.
1246329_a2764158|so we moved to a place near friedberg.
1180724_a2679732|they want that/
1289462_a2397515|i'd stay home all day.
1210825_a3288699|i was glad to get back home, back to my workplace.
1182062_a2774410|but why?
1248862_a2782270|you can go to the deaf sports community center whenever you feel like it during your free time.
1211752_a2755471|what is that inside the case there? what is it?
1428472_a3220107|it was already coming up back then.
1212218_a2935609|it’s linked together, yes!
1291892_a2030181|the earthquake was extremely powerful and led to collisions.
1180097_a1708975|if they set their turn signal, i was setting my turn signal. that is how we drove.
1211752_a2745555|but i would like to join you on the 27th.
1290754_a3173434|it really was over/
1428225_a2158719|only when it has to pee, that has changed.
1187218_a3121771|but it’s not for me.
1413703_a2304365|it does not have to be a hearing person.
1582205_a2039593|it mostly depends on the person.
1183703_a2760865|that was great.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767665|my turn now. ok.
1204877_a2955831|she was surprised that i had come back home so quickly.
1582205_a2041036|right. it's like that everywhere.
1251334_a3188774|we came in second place with the team once, that was pretty good!
1176407_a2876383|still, i would try to help filling sand into bags and building a sandbag wall as protection.
1429737_a2766363|you are very ambitious, i am not.
1181027_a2169740|it told the whole story from the beginning on up to this youth festival which was the last sequence.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2960622|people cheated quite often.
1429964_a2695545|exactly, it was closed eventually. it used to be on nordstraße [north street = name of the location], there isn't one anymore.
1176846_a2895829|and then she lifted her dress.
1184749_a2766642|we had a diverse leisure program and more free time.
1582654_a3096509|yes.
1182343_a1851591|now, there are the lazy ones of the group and those who want to achieve a good grade.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3163393|i visited her.
1245390_a2782944|the kids with cis were only taught spoken language, that’s why it was worse for them.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2282576|i was always done in no time.
1177436_a3149712|imagine i found ten good houses.
1584411_a2135760|what do you think?
1182062_a2774359|three men and one woman: you.
1430592_a2266143|but i knew very little about life outside the boarding school.
1290754_a3172209|but within the club, klaus hoffmann took over the leadership.
1289623_a2904490|i see.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3289350|so we rather wanted to go to hong kong.
1178347_a2906967|well, that's interesting.
1431896_a2989532|there were old streetcars.
1247205_a2239659|when i realized what had happened, it was already too late.
1180724_a2679116|it's not the same.
1291243_a2382049|he thought everything was great, and i just nodded.
1249620_a2643527|the ci is actually winning then.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2907617|i told them to calm down.
1428038_a2163883|well, diana was sitting in the back without being buckled up; she could have survived.
1184145_a2810068|you should have a look at the train station in leipzig!
1204877_a2926262|but it was true, her son was waiting for her downstairs; she didn’t know what to do with me.
1248862_a2781657|it really is interesting.
1182801_a1941804|yes, it is additionally to the unemployment benefits.
1180556_a2613487|that's true.
1289793_a2958643|the hearing people have a marksmen’s festival as well.
1178364_a2885110|we had to wait a little longer until we were finally able to start walking.
1211752_a3046177|the turn of the year is right around the corner, as well.
1250059_a2477105|i was really interested and asked her what those demonstrations had been like.
1289462_a2396233|that means i’m actually rather deaf, and i know the deaf world.
1432043_a3028276|nice.
1250279_a2936903|communication wouldn’t work.
1181455_a2302353|you can use it as a hiking path, or you can ski and do other things.
1176407_a2878195|i then realized that the towers had actually collapsed. it was unbelievable.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2301088|it's located close to africa.
1584198_a3174035|that makes quite a difference.
1212218_a2964888|actually, i would rather just stay in new york.
1585089_a3103566|like us, around thirty.
1209746_a2021199|2005, every four years/
1178939_a3039093|they only write in german.
1430328_a2178856|but i would also visit another city.
1176407_a2878204|seeing it was overwhelming.
1204691_a2770123|that’s true.
1430328_a2174146|where i live, most of the streets go uphill and downhill.
1244978_a2430838|over time communication worked out fine.
1583214_a1856971|assad has to think about what still lies ahead of him.
1181455_a2296863|i live in baden-baden.
1182062_a2774558|it's new. how great is that?
1178147_a2713862|i had wished we would be successful with the demand for subtitles.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1785875|at some point/ he didn't have this name sign in the past.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2179123|hardly anything grows there.
1179864_a3035000|well, no problem.
1585089_a3093414|he has a lot of belts, eight or nine, i think.
1250059_a2518550|there was a positive and a negative side to it.
2025500_a3264449|did uwe want to become chairperson?
1179389_a3530472|they want to sell the houses but it does not work.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2273665|yes, construction draftswoman.
1177436_a3131366|but still/
1211752_a2745784|and you don’t know yet, either.
1418889_a2757889|it really went well for quite some time until i had to give up the job for health reasons.
1212402_a2774267|i worked on the different tasks until i finished everything. then i turned everything in.
1211752_a2750564|i don’t think you would manage, i might, though.
1184536_a2430075|in africa, they speak french and english.
1246772_a2388419|until after three years all the money was gone.
1250279_a2941033|if you send the fax, does the interpreter immediately call someone on your behalf to notify them?
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3013592|like this, parents.
1419607_a3395918|yet, instead of supporting the deaf people financially, the doctors get payed big money for their operations.
1180724_a2522718|do you mean, when you get a ci as a little child?
1248090_a2699603|i would need to study it more, really.
1212218_a2456528|that’s why they don’t like to do it anymore.
1584545_a2202804|halle is mainly known for the halloren chocolate, especially their chocolate globes.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2783718|for hearing people, it’s always the same people.
1204239_a2623234|ah, in #name31.
1184756_a3152512|that’s right.
1250279_a3115881|that’s true.
1211752_a2743643|oh, to ludwigsburg.
1212176_a2779165|when the teacher was gone, we were happy and signed.
1414503_a2774078|#name1 asked the doctor to lift their head so i could see the mouth.
1248400_a2752474|i'm a retiree in germany.
1247525_a2531643|many.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2394984|the floor is also especially made for the hard of hearing.
1248862_a2784954|we got given some phone numbers.
1419265_a2971977|i just remembered something relating to that.
1418889_a2759067|and what happened then?
1212416_a2479387|only after his death i came to know about him, before i didn't.
1584855_a1993551|the other person asked, “the alternator?”
1248400_a2752490|they have roughly 70 employees and they have a contract and work together with [a company in] china.
1179224_a3275608|there are very many unemployed people living in wilhelmsburg.
1432043_a3037595|many tourists come to visit, that’s good.
1247205_a2243800|70 euros.
1176407_a2878445|the corresponding museum commemorates the many victims. it gave me goose bumps.
1244581_a2515361|they are still investigating.
1428805_a3036455|i was completely incapable of doing anything.
1181240-15572825-16003603_a3190985|then i put her hair into a ponytail.
1429781-13002707-13070302_a2366624|today she is quite sad, because i am here, signing.
1289623_a2904620|yes.
1210763_a2740340|i'd love to go climbing sometime.
1204691_a2847207|that used to be my dream.
1427810_a3035586|only if we had used something up and needed new stuff, i bought it there.
1181455_a2302581|what was it?
1432043_a2961896|people from all over the world are coming.
1209006_a2563958|it's only once a year with that much beer.
1250061-12113327-12180631_a2928301|you mean afghanistan?
1182062_a2774412|that's why you go to town on your own.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2809363|i asked for the correct answer.
1212611_a2781738|through my behavior, the tutor reacted and possibly got a bad conscience.
1182801_a1944023|
1181397_a2248787|he loved his niece.
1181240-15572825-16003603_a3190893|the others are eight and ten, they can do it themselves.
1177436_a3134373|they just looked away arrogantly and turned around.
1250646_a3022238|you mentioned ”karo” already.
1249951_a2766919|great, that‘s interesting.
1431222_a2139453|
1176340_a2293637|when my sister and i were little/
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2749712|yes, 50 km//h.
1413703_a3742447|that‘s why hard of hearing people put their hands up, participated numerously and pushed aside the deaf athletes.
1292768_a2386689|that was during the vocational college.
1419265_a2972047|some couples from different cultures work out, others don’t.
1180024_a3077225|he looks inside.
1418903_a2911320|he was so generous that way.
1419370_a3857184|doesn’t matter.
1291243_a2381653|matte or shiny?
1176624_a2880888|when i took it out, i poked it to see if it was done.
1431896_a3910151|2007, maybe 2006/
1430328_a2178617|it is a famous restaurant, but well. the other two are great too.
1212218_a2935145|and all those smooth ceilings and floors, those columns, were carved by hand.
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3033799|‘uphosterer’?
1177918_a2881350|right, i see.
1247205_a2212734|that's right.
1176624_a2882325|the deaf person really liked the cake.
1249620_a2689353|people should feel welcome when coming to the deaf associations or deaf clubs.
1181027_a2165976|there was not one program for everyone, but different ones simultaneously at various times.
1209077_a2254475|it's because of school that deaf people don't like reading.
1177436_a3167209|that’s it.
1584855_a1993350|he didn't want us to scrub work and to stay at home, but to come back to work.
1177002_a3374480|but that’s not my problem.
1432043_a3042791|yes.
1211515_a3248782|i always enjoyed going back to school.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2904076|“great, she’s still asleep. shh, quiet.“
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2899648|why did she need one at all?
1178347_a2904993|that's true, she simply send the babysitter away.
1246772_a2388398|these were the first things to do.
1177436_a3142036|but if that‘s missing, well, that’s difficult.
1245390_a2775048|i met him for the first time there.
1419607_a3403321|i did not plan on sticking to that rule though, we already had agreed on getting around it by signing.
1289793_a2958763|they’re parked behind it, you can lock them there.
1431428_a2542700|all in all it was really great!
1247205_a2212351|does it need to be reported to the police?
1413251_a3035814|i’ll stick to the german language, because i am a confident german.
1182062_a2774710|i went to the vocational school in heidelberg, i had a job there and a rental apartment.
1419607_a3409881|he said he was unable to understand anything, literally anything. i cannot comprehend it. ah, whatever.
1413451-11105600-11163240_a3040649|that gets to me.
1177860_a3194331|everything is going well.
1429964_a2205738|yes, maybe because the others didn't get it and maybe that's why.
1204239_a3066630|and i don’t know about the younger generation either.
1176566_a1707940|that is a royal decree.
1584411_a2072648|my dream jobs used to be math teacher, swimming coach, or physical ed/
1414563_a3073586|so, i worked in that trade in prison/
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767804|that's why i quit and rather started something new.
1250721_a3906233|these things i could notice.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a3112934|there were four of us.
1184145_a2796593|we don’t have vineyards like the ones in your region.
1583950_a3282520|i used to be a huge fan of football, but i just can’t anymore. i had to make a change.
1184367_a2568174|that's why i was so impressed. enough about that now.
1178147_a2713900|all in all it was just as incredible as i imagined it would be.
1290121_a2898130|today, the audience blazes from the colors they have painted their faces with, and people wear big, crazy hats.
1427725_a2118004|and if you win there, you're allowed to go to, what's it called again, the american/
1177640_a3079471|he climbs down from the ladder.
1178133_a2896320|that was very complicated.
1205568_a2807269|they said, “bed wetter, yuck, you pig!“
1431690_a2244962|it worked! the water receded and everybody was relieved.
1414503_a2987963|i tried to calm my husband down.
1414503_a2773951|i said to my mother, “well, see? so much for them not being here.”
1582654_a3099823|whatever.
1430328_a2174600|everything is really far away from where i live.
1432043_a3041106|you get huge serving sizes at the beach.
1176566_a1709339|if someone travels a greater distance to get there but didn't sign up beforehand, it shouldn't matter anyway.
1290126_a3237621|it’d be better to fight for the east to be elevated to the same level as the west.
1220195_a2053375|but a ci can't repair the hearing of a deaf; how would that be possible?
1247205_a2243490|yes, all expenses paid.
1220195_a2042801|i said, “great, you sign, very good.”
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767698|up to today, i sign with him.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2783600|so, usually i just meet up with other deaf people and we get up to something.
1182062_a2774609|there's one in karlsruhe, do you know it?
1289462_a2395977|yes, it’s like a warning.
1290581_a3243682|of course there is a connection.
1211752_a2952525|what’s important is that we take something away from it.
1180092_a3014404|yes, that’s right.
1431896_a2987520|that is how i experienced it back then.
1419607_a3399251|tee-hee. [reaction to moderator’s comment.]
1428225_a2157109|i met my boyfriend there.
1428225_a2158652|but i can't hear the music at all.
1246100_a2746035|only afterwards i learned that by doing so, one automatically gets connected to the german association of the deaf.
2025500_a3276883|i use this sign.
1431896_a2984805|to me it feels like implanting is an act of violence.
1181027_a2166058|6000, the killer!
1220195_a2049738|i was surprised.
1419931_a2315672|but my ‘berliner schnauze’ is annoying for others.
1210997_a2728223|i sent a response once again hinting at our regular use of the room when bowling, or holding assemblies and elections.
2025500_a3266503|i would like to pass on all my knowledge.
1251334_a3167593|suddenly it was reduced to so little.
1247525_a2529194|usually, i play at 9 a.m.
1209077_a3856943|
1210997_a2734353|people were able to attend the guided tour in fürstenfeldbruck or in dachau.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2282716|#name2 told me that she would have to continue her studies with a master's degree after she passed her bachelor's degree.
1432043_a3037686|and the vehicle chuggles along on the top.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2398491|maybe it's loud in the beginning.
1290126_a3240925|just once a year. they were incredibly frugal.
1584411_a2876717|shall i just give him my extra hours as a gift?
1181027_a2169864|i remember that film still today, because it was that good.
1419370_a3317678|but i don’t know that.
1246344_a2465470|but nowadays i am not really sure anymore/
1181602_a3094914|well, almost like being newborn.
1244796_a3078517|the speaker will naturally repeat some of the signs throughout the talk.
1432043_a3030426|they have a castle park with a beautiful castle; it has four towers, one on each corner.
1210997_a2736570|it worked out, great! bravo!
1432043_a3042665|on one side of the bridge there’s germany, the other side is denmark.
1181159_a3217206|i lived only 20 minutes away; so, i chose to commute back and forth.
1211752_a3112750|i would pay them no mind.
1178768_a1996200|right.
1180097_a1707657|my driving instructor asked me, what was wrong.
1247205_a2243460|i cannot know what's going to happen in the future.
1210997_a2753803|booking the room was free of charge.
1178939_a3074549|it’d be more balanced.
1244581_a2514991|the tsunami had destroyed everything!
1249620_a2960563|some have an understanding about people communicating in sign language.
1180724_a2678847|she sometimes takes them to my mother who watches the kids for her.
1177002_a3259539|the question is whether you want a deaf child or whether you don’t care.
1585089_a3094041|do you know why?
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2907364|it is more difficult for me with germans.
1433543_a2997897|they meet up to chat.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2959627|seriously, i slightly pushed him aside and got a red card right away. sick!
1430590_a2259027|it took the others a long time to find the right letters, but not me, i arranged them right away.
1433543_a2985016|then definitely a trip to chiemsee and/
1245820_a2862699|yet, what about the hospital?
1582654_a3096546|that‘s so long!
1291572_a2633942|sometimes you just don't realize it.
1250646_a3022262|i didn’t know that.
1180092_a3014417|right, but those triangles are sometimes yellow, too.
1205503_a2772486|nobody believed it could be any different.
1184089_a2760407|i then read about it again and finally understood it.
1582841_a1782275|they maintained discipline and order there.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a3113146|so, the first group is using sign language.
1289462_a2395544|we discussed two topics.
1184145_a2810119|i am at the deaf community center most of the time.
1250972_a2766173|at some point my doctor told me that there were some complications with the pregnancy: the baby was sitting very low in my belly.
1291572_a2693704|i found my path, god showed me the way. he showed me that i must be free.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2898187|i was responsible for the material saw.
1584198_a3186060|exactly as it was, sentence by sentence, like in a movie.
1290126_a3240956|when they told me that, i was surprised and asked what it was like with the fruit there, what kind of choices they had.
1585453_a1934841|no, the cathedral square was the arrival point.
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3078943|i sign brown, quite different.
1204691_a2850335|the cloth gets cut in germany and then sent to india.
1413683_a2563007|the germans were really good soccer players. i had been a good player back in slovakia. yet, everyone in germany was twice as good as me.
1184749_a2766604|she forced me to, so i had to accept it and go to the realschule [type of secondary school in germany] in munich.
1584411_a2876682|i didn't like that.
1250721_a3317763|she was from thuringia.
1247835_a2632628|the communication between us worked well.
1427368_a3242762|but not for me, i’m growing older and older. i am turning #x soon.
1180254_a2172724|ok, so you used to sign at school.
1211531_a2046482|even though they received money, they were unsatisfied.
1290126_a2457390|wait, one question: they were on the swimming team, so athletes?
1431896_a2996839|um.
1205503_a2737929|the common opinion of the nobles was this:
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805067|so few!
1212218_a2996350|okay, right.
1204694_a2789688|his wife is very possessive of him, that makes me jealous.
1250646_a3022245|i did have crates.
2025500_a3266388|you mean at the city of brandenburg?
1249620_a2598752|they don’t know what it means.
1430592_a2266509|i read a lot.
1204691_a2847219|it only worked together, one needed to be able to cut and sew, too.
1428472_a3228828|learning beforehand is better.
1431676_a3247386|
1177436_a3134082|objectively, interpreters could stick to secrecy.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3157945|can you send me an email?
1419265_a2972119|hm, what did i want to say?
1583214_a1858798|i once was very sad.
1211752_a3054118|to the north.
1212611_a2780781|i ignored him.
1183846_a2864930|the ivt showed me how confident deaf people can be and i am very thankful for that.
1418858_a2949883|it was well thought out.
1250721_a3348732|and since i’m a severely disabled person, my foreman really stood up for me, so there weren’t any problems.
1204877_a2954359|no, that never happened.
1432043_a3041063|most of the people eat fish.
1582841_a1783828|i asked him if i was a guinea pig or what?
1290581_a2954758|many hearing people were at the deaflympics.
1585089_a2474956|chisora was suspended.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2357620|
1247205_a2240165|oh, including your workplace, as well?
1414563_a3098458|that was it, i guess.
1246102_a2819234|the audience picked her; that's how she got back into the competition.
1414563_a3902615|lucky you.
1183426_a2785047|when i came to germany my parents had problems to communicate with the educators.
1290126_a3230467|a lot of things changed for the people.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2301108|the island we went to with our class was really nice as well.
1204877_a2936904|i did my apprenticeship close to munich.
1210206-11564230-11595227_a2779630|they found the shooter quickly and the police immediately arrested him.
1220195_a2054303|who/
1245603_a3080498|the next day, everyone meets for breakfast at 7 am, just like it said on the schedule.
1206131_a3060269|that may very well be.
1291572_a2564683|i accepted that.
1204239_a2623343|oh okay.
1290581_a2934343|soon i’ll go traveling again, to mexico.
1177860_a3189467|you can just do it in the basement.
1246772_a2387400|true, it was during the time i held a talk when you told me that it was in full swing.
1212218_a2940776|the red khmer waged a war in cambodia.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2002281|#mr. name5 fell round my neck. i didn’t like that as much.
1583882_a2876972|i thought it would cost 2.50.
1250646_a3097388|but the light beer was sensitive. whenever there was a thunderstorm, it would turn sour.
1413683_a2561046|he said i had to choose between going back home and staying there, and having the freedom and opportunity to visit any place in the world.
1220195_a2054416|yes, that's right.
1177002_a3259707|to turn to you, what do you think?
1431642-17445220-17471818_a3952308|
1212176_a2779162|i rather copied what was written down and talked to people in sign language.
1209746_a2023207|but onshore, everything around me was destroyed.
1177702_a2874494|how are we with the time?
1430592_a2267116|i had to push through that.
1177002_a3253131|you can’t change anything about their attitude anymore, it is what it is.
1582654_a3109942|there was an awesome boat going from copenhagen to malmö in sweden.
1250646_a3022278|a used car costs 3000, so most would rather get a new one.
1246681_a3256215|during a hunt, hagen stabs him in the spot on his back marked by a cross. that’s how it is told.
1427725_a2141670|do you think that fashion started out as well-behaved?
1428805_a2981087|my body would impoverish and i would look odd.
1414312_a2781888|these events worked out well up to this day.
1177918_a2881403|in the first half it was different: croatia was in the lead.
1248090_a2695903|many understood everything.
1431428_a2542502|well, we had missed the opening.
1176846_a2887078|there are different versions.
1181159_a3223249|his preaching was exclusively oral.
1177436_a3017635|it didn’t concern me.
1290996-15110219-15155045_a2087853|yes, he was.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2804907|true, i’m about to leave school.
1248699_a2740739|
1427725_a2878742|though, i think it is questionable if all the answers were equally good.
1248941-12280641-12344740_a2928764|i'm with you on that.
1291636_a3085598|we didn’t notice anything and slept until the next morning.
1584329-15450503-15475829_a3192011|with that, i loosen the screws.
1289462_a3025307|
1245390_a2774269|that was really nice.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787952|the true story, that’s how it is.
1250972_a2941897|she added that i might work in the meatpacking department.
1248090_a2696025|unfortunately, i haven‘t learned it until this day.
1181027_a2169672|yes, right, about the expert committee.
1247835_a2632781|i then replied, “no, no,” and explained it to them.
1585286_a1924278|i was like, “ok.”
1585089_a3086402|until the next blow, he just fell over.
1178939_a3039051|that’s interesting!
2025500_a3277060|once again, you don‘t mean hear but ‘listening with the eyes!’
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2882556|the eud can start new research itself.
1428805_a2983462|i eat healthily.
1250721_a3347068|but nothing of the sort! that’s bullshit.
1183846_a2864988|it was really good.
1182062_a2773316|she was strong.
1292125_a2071259|i asked myself what would happen next.
1582654_a3110279|i went to italy for two weeks and watched.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2896175|you can bite the camera release that is in front of your mouth to take a picture.
1181159_a3147366|no, no, it was one hour of classes, and then later on another hour there.
1182343_a1851598|if all three guys are motivated you can get better, though.
1212176_a2752028|if i had lived in the north - i don't know.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1769592|
1582439_a2020954|well, if i look at the situation i think that she is still like that.
1212176_a2779466|that's nice.
1248400_a2750344|who am i supposed to vote for then?
1427725_a2098761|the eyes were made up with black coal so they would turn dark.
1187152_a3074042|okay, okay.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2208911|a few special features.
1180724_a2663736|one is surprised when that person gets a ci all of a sudden.
1419607_a3409896|no, no, deaf/
1184145_a2810090|no way, the platforms are down below. it isn’t very nice and the hallways are so narrow.
1419610-11552205-12003930_a3400282|that was good for him. he moved into a nice apartment for elderly people.
1182801_a1943769|back in the day, their six children would be the pension scheme for the parents.
1178133_a2899856|i saw it, i went there, to ratzeburg close to lübeck.
1180556_a2909446|true, they are.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2398470|later/
1413683_a2561028|you were forced to choose one out of ten occupations. there were no other options.
1212176_a2778949|it tasted weird.
1289793_a2958453|i would say, half the population of bielefeld.
1431676_a3247607|you should know that my wife doesn‘t wear a hijab. she lives freely.
1249951_a2764681|however, it is not a sandy beach; it's pebbly.
1204877_a2938503|when i got a new work position, i moved to passau.
1433410_a2382925|my parents somehow managed to always find out what was going on at parties in the deaf community.
1250646_a3006538|”well, it’s a bit late already, it’s not worth it anymore“, he said.
1427725_a2118059|after you've won the beauty pageant the choice is up to you.
1210206-11564230-11595227_a2786738|i was shocked about the death of this man, even though i’m not interested in the news or politics myself.
1177702_a2871782|this way i slowly got more and more.
1427725_a2099202|but where do they get their employees from?
1245820_a2871239|too bad that we don't have a good regional association for the saarland. bummer.
1204239_a3078594|i would arrive in ulm only at around eleven, but it doesn’t matter.
1291636_a3095784|it was kept inside of it.
1290121_a2767577|i think the history of german soccer is very, very interesting, and i love watching it.
1291892_a2155449|politicians refused and felt superior to the little citizens.
1430328_a2174774|it was typical for cologne that important church dignitaries were buried right next to the cathedral.
1176566_a1706137|i have to accept that.
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3114030|well, inclusion is all right.
1433543_a3024104|with that, one wears a hat with a feather and a red and white collar.
1248400_a2714092|they think about changing the legislative period to five years.
1220195_a2042789|he asked if we were deaf.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2394837|the main point is that the child is healthy.
1211515_a3248633|that’s something i had to do as well.
1583214_a1858812|my son intervened and told them that he would take both kittens.
1183846_a2864950|i was stunned.
1582654_a2659366|yes, but i‘ll keep it short.
1429781-13002707-13070302_a2358674|i was only told by a few that they didn’t feel like it and wanted to go home.
1582654_a2659400|to canada?
1182062_a2774580|that sucks.
1431277-12504848-12590316_a2471186|it’s working.
1585453_a1936557|yes, sports events.
1245820_a2855397|you wanted that topic. so, you must know something to say about it.
1250059_a2478662|
1413925_a2821182|that’s better.
1428225_a2158723|when he is noisy, i am not able to hear that of course. but our neighbors in the flat above don't complain either and are friendly.
1427810_a2456729|two should be enough.
1183426_a2785051|they were russian and didn’t really know german, but still they tried to communicate somehow.
1249620_a2642640|there were very few hearing people.
1419610-11552205-12003930_a3401219|one was wondering about his finger, the other about how odd his nose felt.
1246772_a2810320|but i told him that i really didn't want to teach monday through friday evenings.
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3282296|yes, that person.
1247205_a3918281|no, i´ll start over again.
1428907-11590941-12015445_a2429210|it felt so strange: she was dead. unbelievable! and i asked myself, “why did she die?”
1419797_a2743786|i don't want to offend them, but that is just the way it is.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2901285|the wound was properly stitched.
1183917_a2872221|approximately?
1211515_a3248390|back then, they didn’t have swimming pools.
1244581_a2515327|what for?
1585286_a1925972|it was pretty extreme.
1181602_a3096334|there are different flats with different numbers of roommates, two, three or four.
1245390_a2782355|but we sat next to each other for some talks and there were some questions being posed that i was often agreeing with.
1427368_a3242958|that’s why i take an interpreter.
1200689_a2169584|we used sign language to communicate with my mother. thus, i understood a lot.
1184164_a2771024|well, i don't know.
1292768_a2386499|well, ok.
1584617_a3267004|
1244978_a2443019|then i screwed the lid back on.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767621|then i had my first daughter.
1244581_a2514932|i was puzzled: 80,000!
1250966_a2551141|my father told me about the one time that he crossed the border with his school class.
1245820_a2857343|yet, the realization is still a bit off.
1182062_a2772507|yes, rewe.
1585453_a1937780|i forgot the name of the theater.
1432043_a2962213|so we went by ship.
1181159_a3225055|it‘s completely different when you have to go to your room at 10 p.m. that‘s when you‘re not free at all.
1246329_a2762957|i still remember the way.
1179224_a3253410|yes, you won’t be able to get up or down the tower anymore and experience the view from up there.
1419265_a2967047|a man and a woman get married, no, do they get married?
1413703_a2310553|i was supposed to go to malmö in 1973 as well, but unfortunately i was injured.
1247525_a2558424|if a person wants to dope him- or herself then that's fine, but they should do it at their own health risk.
1251334_a3177416|the 3000-meters race.
1209910_a3086391|after the sports, we celebrated, that was nice.
1211515_a3247208|we used to play cowboys-and-indians, and pretended to be just like the cowboys and natives in the movies.
1584198_a3179682|but in both cases it was about the work environment.
1582205_a2039738|the money you file an application for and then get is like a normal wage for the assistants.
1183846_a2864865|how old were you then?
1428821-16453820-16510849_a3189069|so i check whether there are any visible bubbles.
1210825_a3283413|when they asked me questions, i made a mistake and answered another person than the one who was asking me questions.
1209746_a2022640|we later went on to australia and so on.
1250059_a2481521|there weren't any deaf members.
1248400_a2744596|do they constantly vote?
1248862_a2784185|he explained to them that there wasn’t anything.
1289462_a2876432|you weren’t sad, although you heard less?
1290581_a2937263|i’d like to do it at one point, but who knows when.
1419370_a3348246|it would have been possible then, because they were also cheaper.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2808917|some are new ones.
1428225_a2158628|the interpreter did a great job, it was beautiful.
1427810_a2456767|yes, right, that’s good.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a3129219|in this group there are children with various hearing abilities, but they all use sign language as their mother language.
1248505_a2757141|no way, the papers didn't write about that.
1248400_a2742137|yes, but everyone has to keep quiet and hide.
1249620_a2599045|take my hearing aids, for example.
1179224_a3253502|the reeperbahn has become more professional, now a man has to pay at least 200 euros to get a woman; it is something for wealthy men nowadays.
1184756_a2458207|we were so shy.
1246329_a2756035|my father had a good life there.
1212402_a2739567|we stayed with mrs. #name3.
1178347_a2896196|but after they fought for it, they put the flag at half-mast.
1177002_a3252858|it also means that you take away your child’s chance to decide for him- or herself.
1292125_a2063515|if there aren't any clouds, it means there's no wind, either.
1431222_a2136250|i've only been to the one in cologne.
1180254_a2176496|they were great for me, too.
1429310_a2261244|since the world games in denmark the test against stimulant usage were mandatory.
1290581_a2937895|you also were in taipeh, in taiwan.
1181455_a2324322|yes!
1249741_a2783996|there are cows on the meadows grazing.
1431690_a2244952|i looked closely at the walls but couldn't detect anything.
1249741_a2795880|there was also a lot/
1176566_a1706120|you don't have to act as an autocrat, saying, “all of this is mine”. that would be your own fault.
1210825_a3264183|once a sentence is rephrased, it’s easy to grasp.
1244796_a2848021|i am innocent. oh well.
1220195_a2044790|that's the reason why.
1430832_a2449683|no, he was just like everybody else.
1433543_a2997821|that’s all possible and i think that’s lovely.
1178147_a2713897|the lectures that followed one another were okay.
1182517_a2337501|i didn‘t want to go, but the teacher accompanied me and said, “everything is going to be fine!”
1179868_a2570896|and then i have to get a rowboat and look above the water surface to see where i'm going.
1413251_a3056552|if we were to already start with a european sign language while only half of the establishing of a german sign language dictionary is done, there would be two parallel ways we’d be going.
1583950_a3250206|we were a group of deaf people with only two hard of hearing people among us.
1247199_a2377686|she has a son, as well.
1184536_a2934225|around the time of the economic crisis in 1913, many people escaped and emigrated to the u.s.
1418889_a2707134|one time we pulled a prank and smeared soap all over the blackboard.
1431676_a3247155|i was a member of the sports club in bielefeld.
1176566_a1706129|i think i would have much more to do if i was working with the senior gathering.
1247205_a2238410|however, i was lucky to meet the owner immediately, and everything worked out well.
1290581_a3243143|i think it wasn’t ‘goldfinger’.
1246102_a2816031|i thought the same thing, until i had finished school and went to vocational school for about two years.
1413703_a2310574|well, i/
1182343_a1857421|the student blushed while she was desperately trying to locate it on the map.
1184145_a2810058|horrible.
1178133_a2894225|how did they do that?
1179390-14072944-14151525_a1999786|this is not okay. i'd rather have them integrate this into an act.
1248505_a2851550|i told her it was her fault that she went with the others to see the soccer stadium.
1176846_a2884283|yes, exactly, weddings.
1181011_a2012365|exactly, it is as simple as that.
1431224_a2149980|my coach, well the national coach, said to me, “it is your goal to participate in the games.”
1248862_a2782176|they got given everything and were completely adored.
1184756_a3101647|i wrote to her that they would beat me up if i cheered for germany.
1247641_a2866170|well, what can i say here?
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2933248|oh, the new one.
1289462_a2395817|i’m not used to it, and i feel uncomfortable if i have to ask again.
1290754_a3171302|the club was founded in 1967.
1250059_a2477172|right, they kept demonstrating, because they wanted to get rid of all the problems.
1432043_a3037665|yes.
1427810_a2456763|i’m open to everything there, too.
1428472_a3227967|should one operate on a child’s skull, which is still growing?
1177002_a3259503|but that’s an entirely different question.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805060|exactly, the deaf people are more interested in a solid, common group.
1250966_a2545220|they showed how bad it was, people were shot and killed.
1245462_a2904923|yes, that would be bad.
1205168_a2850794|soccer brings us closer together.
1432043_a2967778|you can visit the whole area there.
1205568_a2780422|i got hit more and more.
1582654_a3109925|that was quite strange, actually.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767669|she was into politics, but that was not for me, so i felt somewhat inferior.
1180556_a2595416|yes, it is a floor lamp.
1212176_a2752166|but nowadays, with computers and new information, a lot of time is wasted.
1413703_a3522469|they just took it.
1209006_a2799981|that's true.
1212402_a2771316|“shush! be quiet!”
1428805_a2986327|which is great.
1430328_a2182315|i don't know where it was exactly; there were some meadows and a river, maybe the rhine.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2899548|the implant can be placed a little obliquely.
1180556_a2678328|then you are not allowed to drive there.
1249376_a2842054|no, yes.
1582205_a2905147|right.
1244978_a2433331|for instance with the projector/
1246681_a3255746|the deidesheimer hof.
1427368_a3231970|some politicians had known about it already, but we had no clue.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2878903|you mean german for foreigners?
1177436_a3017612|in potsdam there’s ”potsmods” [former degree programme for social work and the like for deaf students], that’s very fortunate.
1428472_a3227982|it’s also a bit of the mothers’ fault that the doctor earns money with that.
1292458_a3028865|that’s typical, it’s shown that way in movies.
1419370_a3325186|no, i don’t agree.
1211075_a1979028|i wonder what she would look like today. i'd like to see that.
1209309-13425110-13472919_a2792221|it’ll be revealed.
1249951_a2766589|it still has to be pleasant.
1432043_a3039163|it’s just/
1427810_a2456859|that’s good, i like strong legs.
1427725_a2099452|by then you will only be wearing underway.
1249951_a2766786|unfortunately, that's the time when the crowds are gathering, as well.
1292086_a2463210|therefore i signed slowly and in a simple way.
1248090_a2695731|she paid for it and told me to come back to her afterwards to pay her back.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2572478|right. i’ve been given a red card before for nothing really. just because i slightly shoved someone to the side.
1211283_a2769867|they have to be encouraged to do so.
1247835_a2632622|it works well with an interpreter.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2813933|if you were naughty, you weren’t allowed to watch tv and had to go upstairs straight away, right?
1182517_a2335854|boys and girls were separated at our place.
1178939_a3002824|we are mainly surrounded by hearing people.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2002066|i still am.
1292768_a2520707|you were supposed to.
1246329_a2763658|we used them to make oil that we gave the teachers. that’s how they’d teach me.
1432043_a3031149|it was because of the salt/
1292458_a2977377|they laughed.
1210763_a2737856|why does one sign tokio like this?
1184749_a2780941|just choose one.
1178347_a2884392|exactly.
1246329_a2757222|he was a police officer in darmstadt and worked in the field office in lindenfels.
1428038_a2159158|they gave up now.
1211752_a2749975|the christmas market is on the 27th of november.
1427810_a3080136|i don’t care about the kind of pasta.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2894017|i felt lost among all the deaf people signing.
1419931_a2964848|what else -
1289462_a2395668|but what about the communication of deaf children?
1209077_a2255374|i'd say half and half.
1419610-11552205-12003930_a3402056|we were supposed to learn to dodge the punches.
1180097_a1683974|there was an interpreter during the actual exam. that worked out really well.
1178133_a2899867|but that was it.
1182801_a1945868|it is really fast.
1291572_a2663205|of course, he's a mama's boy.
1177436_a3142340|well, maybe not ruthless, but that is what they do.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a1999790|there are such acts in other countries, but not so in germany. there is no such thing here.
1582205_a2042491|i think it's interesting how i went to school - that was before the fall of the wall, around 1985 - without being aware of living in the gdr.
1187218_a3191616|if the maximum has been reached, the alarm starts beeping.
1247205_a2212189|i waited for the both of them to come back, and then asked them to whom the car belonged.
1178364_a2882439|the convention was great but the consulting teams weren't.
1419797_a2744335|i didn't like it either when someone tried to do that with me. i don't want that.
1204691_a2771375|but i think that deaf people in the east live better.
1582205_a2041329|i wonder why people tell others to go work in western germany.
1248862_a2780968|we took turns taking breaks so that everybody would be able to look around.
1427810_a3024601|yes.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2400053|i have no idea.
1220195_a2057126|she's jealous, because i'm happy, because i have so many things, everything goes fine with my children, and so on.
1428472_a3219333|the language is different.
1585453_a2903783|and then/
1176340_a2192866|therefore we had the talk with the teacher, my mother and myself to discuss everything.
1250279_a2998876|that’s a help, yes.
1291892_a2156940|that's bad, too.
1248941-12280641-12344740_a3028520|he wouldn’t say a word, just think he is bad — he would be really sad.
1212611_a2781724|the tutor greeted me as if nothing had happened.
1210763_a2738158|those skyscrapers, it's crazy!
1430328_a2173874|this is our culture.
1427810_a2456810|broccoli/
1419265_a2972126|he prepared everything for the breakfast, then my friend joined him.
1585089_a2475006|ah yes, it says so in the charter, that’s right.
1430592_a2969483|my husband also talked to them, but us parents only signed to one another.
1585089_a3101918|yesterday, against dortmund, he also scored.
1431690_a2365195|it was in january.
1413251_a2975597|i mean, you stay german.
1205503_a2736321|he studied babies who didn't have any contact with their mother whatsoever.
1419265_a2972057|for example, er/
1244978_a2433361|yeah, it was dazzling bright! really annoying.
1291243_a2381190|i do, but it comes out too bright.
1177860_a3170269|before he was gone all the time and she was home alone cooking.
1428472_a3228792|i don’t like the operations and the research.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2882040|but the old man was signing fast.
1247641_a2723318|in the deaf community center.
1248505_a2747262|reluctantly, i went with them.
1428038_a2160595|or on the mars where martians could be running around with eyes looking like antennas on their heads.
1428038_a2149427|that's not possible.
1428821-16453820-16510849_a3190548|then the tube gets pulled under the tire.
1245462_a2319265|they signed properly back then. of course they had fun and made jokes, too.
1583950_a3250723|we could sign and visit one another in our different storeys.
1182517_a2337513|at the age of 13 or 14, football became more important.
1178347_a2897767|when diana suddenly died, the queen was unable to reconcile with her and therefore the queen had a guilty conscience.
1433410_a2384356|but they always ask how deaf people do it: how, how, how?
1582654_a3115412|2002, 2003, 2004, no, not 2004, 2003 was the last time.
1184749_a2773260|that was that.
1250721_a3348712|i didn’t have any problems, i just got lucky.
1178939_a3040809|one is used to it and grows up like this.
1582654_a3143387|here, you just take the stairs down to the subway station and show your pass if necessary.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2804984|that’s why i have to check up on the children more often.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2301058|i think i've been there three times.
1584545_a2203450|again/
1180254_a2172673|we were allowed to communicate in whatever way we wanted to.
1419128_a3100002|
1429781-12565132-12585506_a2357258|there were no problems there.
1178939_a3036794|with the integration schools, i also ask myself, are the deaf students distributed everywhere? what do you think?
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2394811|and then what?
1247835_a2605071|the teachers were dull.
1184749_a2766584|growing up, i felt more comfortable in the hearing world, until i came to school in nuremberg.
1184756_a3095437|one of those farmer’s trailers.
1430328_a2178610|there are a lot.
1249951_a2846588|i drove for eight hours - i was exhausted.
1428225_a2158750|never mind.
1212416_a2476745|he was lying on the floor.
1250972_a3917635|sometimes the suits from hamburg, berlin, rostock, and stralsund shuffle in for some conference.
1212402_a2774785|i didn't know anything about that either.
1212218_a2947007|it’s not a problem.
1428472_a3228088|yes, i think it will be gone.
1432043_a3030229|but financing is taking its time.
1584545_a2842792|but they are going to keep the “double-m” landmark.
1290126_a2457355|comparing supportive actions, it was a lot better in the gdr than in germany.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2804968|i always have to check.
1584198_a3228739|when he finally told me that my answer was right, i calmed down a little.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2854336|the others got packages.
1249741_a2795956|there is a big shopping center.
1247199_a2210883|do you know schwarzenegger?
1210825_a3265166|we are working at an independent hospital, and my tag says ”deaf”.
1431642-17445220-17471818_a3952206|many of the talks at the culture days were given simultaneously.
1427810_a2456840|so is it one that takes clear pictures?
1583882_a2876984|so i waited until i got a port from the mail.
1431690_a2142549|we were fascinated by what we saw through the window: the water was really close to the tracks.
1584545_a2284727|it is close to zittau/
1248090_a2699736|hong kong, too.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805065|it’s different: six/
1178364_a2978182|it is just a small group, which is a real shame.
1182343_a1855926|i asked the children what they did like better when comparing lessons at home to the teaching in school.
1178768_a1996185|that's weird.
1245390_a2774242|it was great, completely overwhelming.
1419607_a3399705|no, no.
1184536_a2430080|in my opinion, the culture has to be preserved.
1430328_a2181940|we went to cologne.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a1998145|you're right.
1181159_a3225011|it wasn‘t that great. they have very strict rules, and the food is just weird.
1211531_a2047171|that is not ok.
1182062_a2772350|four times? that’s surprising.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2903990|
1584198_a3179646|the integration office thinks that is really great.
1428472_a3228070|it would be a pity. very sad.
1247205_a2238394|
1290754_a3171074|at some point, a lot of people wanted me to be voted first chairman.
1176340_a2345072|the younger ones rooms were also around the corner.
1182343_a2907103|that's not possible.
1182801_a1943725|it is also understood that deaf people and people with disabilities face more barriers which lead to higher expenses in the end.
1204877_a2954614|i have a foster brother and a foster sister.
1212402_a2733951|but i was excited and happy.
1244978_a2443041|there were more tricks, like the one with the plug.
1427810_a3056967|yes.
1427725_a2115878|the girls with those dresses would have a much higher score even though there are other girls who were just as good.
1428038_a2163765|the english just wanted to see her dead.
1212416_a2477550|it was nice.
1247205_a2243851|that's tricky, but it's all right, i guess.
1177860_a3202679|thin iron plates would work as well.
1419607_a3403165|i was moderately excited about it at first.
1414312_a2766488|before these deaflympics i switched to water polo.
1418858_a2929735|yes, the woman was there as well.
1430328_a2175173|but there aren't really typical dishes that originated in the region where i live now.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2294006|it lasts three weeks.
1178939_a3041019|it’s just completely normal. it doesn’t matter whether someone is hearing or deaf. it’d be a mix.
1433543_a3024081|the socks are short, and the green stripe is an addition.
1582654_a3096548|july is so late, though.
1582205_a2044628|and more and bigger buildings.
1430396_a3268423|it’s important to me to be able to use the toilet at night.
1204239_a3069550|i think that my mum/
1178939_a3005981|yes!
1204691_a2850337|they get paid two or three euros an hour there.
1211752_a2743926|but i’m also happy to have other people join us, that’s not too bad.
1184536_a2385094|french is spoken and signed more softly; it’s because of their words.
1184367_a2582301|culture is also good to show hearing people what the deaf can do.
1427810_a3079979|i don’t care.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a2471077|no.
1211075_a2910004|yes.
1584545_a2239440|and the blue pedestrian bridge, which is also very well known.
1427368_a3243348|no, i didn’t need interpreters.
1414503_a3659790|my husband said that he had trouble breathing.
1427725_a2099600|the trains would have to change as well.
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3014115|i use the sign family.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2394704|that's possible, too.
1183203_a3150094|yet, he was ordered to sort them according to color first.
1291572_a2693819|that's why i'm in a bad fix.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a1996431|i think it's the same increase.
1244796_a3078482|back then i already understood the sign but they still fingerspelled it.
1211752_a2743919|i know a few people.
1432043_a3037656|well.
1209077_a2251306|they aren't deaf; the word isn't suitable, because they have a ci.
1289793_a2932675|the music in the different rooms isn’t the same.
1583043_a1856162|but back to erfurt.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2404097|i'm feeling it.
1177266_a3014237|well.
1247205_a2238543|after it had happened, my mother told me to quickly drive home.
1246329_a2757247|
1177702_a2871584|there just wasn't any room in the apartment.
1184145_a2810073|now the train station is renovated.
1211531_a2047674|it used to be like that back then.
1184536_a2479538|alright, so cold coffee. i was just hoping she’d bring the right drink.
1246102_a2818265|that was due to a beauty pageant in las vegas, where she had participated as well.
1184367_a2750537|they think deaf people are always sad.
1184145_a2793244|i went on a guided tour.
1248699_a2740822|my sister said, “look at that, all channels show the same thing over and over again.“
1246772_a2386982|i didn't recognize you!
1419370_a3321078|yes, that’s right.
1250721_a3314440|and all that even though she was a single mother of three.
1419370_a3335646|yes, cutting it off!
1428472_a3228166|if there are more people with cis i’m lucky i can sign.
1182801_a1944018|
1583950_a3257894|it all went on and i still hadn’t found a job.
1291636_a3090280|of course, the alarms during the day i experienced at school, during the lessons.
1585089_a2475074|not if you consider the price.
1246329_a2763438|one day a friend came around at noon and gave me an apple.
1210825_a3262612|but she didn’t like the idea either, because as a masseur i would have problems communicating with hearing people.
1205568_a2810611|i went to a sawmill and told them, “i want to work here, i am done with school.“
1179868_a2570866|i think in, i don’t know, fifty years maybe, bremen will be gone.
1250721_a3315232|but not everyone was politically active, not at all.
1413485_a2712224|every year one thinks of her.
1180024_a3077222|the boy continues his search.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2804869|yes, you concentrate more on it.
1430396_a3267942|that’s a small village in the eifel where our family lives.
1413251_a2975676|i mean, 30 years, no, i don’t think so.
1249951_a2845372|we should get a break from all this snow now, as far as i'm concerned.
1289793_a2952273|oh well, the club is famous as well.
1177002_a2974881|have you ever witnessed someone you know to have a black child via a donor?
2021499_a2600604|you'd cry and scream and scream.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2992870|yesterday after the game against the team from duisburg, the train was packed once again.
1582205_a2041021|politically seen there's no difference anymore.
1250721_a3314871|”one pound of butter.”
1184756_a3119156|well, no. i flew to düsseldorf, hopped on another one and went all the way to nuremberg.
1419607_a3389431|i am a non-smoker.
1248862_a2784220|they just wanted to leave.
1247849_a2795273|he probably wanted to show his family clan.
1413251_a2991475|they manage with asl.
1204691_a2773400|the elder people, yes.
1205821_a2504616|both of them leaving together would have meant the chance for both to escape.
1582654_a3109874|there wasn‘t even a real turd.
1179868_a2587960|you should really buy one soon.
1249741_a2794565|it's really interesting.
1246566_a3065451|and all of those things occasion costs.
1248941-12280641-12344740_a2934291|the price could be lowered.
1290754_a3172231|i know there was a color company that wanted to take over the area.
1210825_a3267628|that quiets them down a bit.
1433543_a3558455|exactly, paragliding.
1249302_a2535503|i missed the games in cologne.
1247205_a2238987|didn't you see anything?
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2944871|obviously, both of them said, “all right, all right,” and promised to stop arguing.
1209077_a2251085|more research is needed on how it's possible to not only let hair grow, but also how hearing itself works.
1583322-12534537-13002913_a2517792|he talked about it in dresden and everyone was quite impressed. the news spread like wildfire.
1248505_a2757080|there is more to it than meets the eye.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2789778|a little bit.
1250646_a3022277|it was a market for cars.
1182517_a2343877|you already had to be in pyjamas for being allowed to watch the match.
1427368_a3243378|i wanted to pay him a visit.
1250061-12113327-12180631_a2615984|three.
1431277-12504848-12590316_a2471208|i had six hours of school as a child, six hours.
1183720-17021701-17054739_a2757290|until i/
1427810_a3035582|everything.
1428472_a3219296|no/ many of them are different. they’re all different, oh well.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2884264|don’t they have enough money?
2021499_a2597793|if the towers had fallen sideways, maybe more would have died.
1419607_a3414533|in principle, deaf schools are good.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805132|most of the hearing people talk to one another, come up and speak.
1430396_a3269618|we looked at the cells, the strands - i don’t remember the proper name anymore, but we were taught all that back then - in great detail.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2819042|what? that many?
1289462_a2397568|i don't really know.
1290754_a3173287|it wasn’t child’s play, one needs to be brave.
1183203_a3140127|many mothers are affected by it.
1209006_a2699917|and it didn't even taste that good.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1776738|the sport group meets on monday evenings.
1583322-12534537-13002913_a2528294|one of my teachers was mr. #name1.
1289462_a2396377|no matter if it was noisy or if many people were around me.
1419265_a2972781|but the bride used to be in love with someone else and had to decide.
1248400_a2711585|they had to close for two or three days because they were waiting for requested spare parts.
1431982_a3082423|oh boy.
1177640_a3080969|
1205821_a2492133|my mother stayed with her grandmother.
1430328_a2178682|do they cook differently?
1182062_a2771663|they don’t? then what?
1250721_a3314325|she often asked me to practice my speaking.
1431222_a2139801|just the protest, that’s it.
1181159_a3225434|going back and forth for every break or for lunch.
1204191_a3911160|heiligen/
1292768_a2386564|i went there right away.
1180026_a3077382|the dog jumps down after him.
1244796_a3084265|or i mix up the signs for grandpa and ‘grandma’.
1414312_a2771645|the sign rome [same form as the sign for ‘chaos’] came about when we arrived at the deaflympics there and nothing was prepared for the games.
1583950_a3250105|that annoyed me.
1413451-11105600-11163240_a2835037|i'm not able to perceive the world the way a hearing person would, and i cannot communicate well with hearing people. i always encounter difficulties when doing so.
1430590_a2256870|i stayed there for quite a while.
1428821-16453820-16510849_a3192851|if the wheel doesn’t wobble, everything is alright.
1183917_a2871910|but they keep postponing the reconstruction whilst still telling tourists to travel to phi phi so they can earn money; that’s a difficult situation.
1427368_a3242537|it is very difficult.
1292770_a2912050|yet, i had spoken before that, when i was around seven or eight years old.
1205503_a2746767|it is happy when its mother is close and it hears her voice.
1250061-12113327-12180631_a2538355|she told me that she had been there before, and that the entire area was really beautiful.
1582205_a2040341|many people from the west think eastern germany doesn't have to pay it, but that's not true.
1245390_a2782353|exchanging opinions with him was tough.
1250972_a2766086|the day before i started working, i got my work clothes including a hairnet, gloves, a work coat and so on.
1248941-12280641-12344740_a2930478|it's annoying sometimes.
1290126_a3230428|i always looked at it thinking that life there [in the east] was harder.
1584545_a2284994|lighting candles, putting up nutcrackers/
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2886701|and this the h.
1419931_a2273341|because berlin is germany’s capital.
1248862_a2788333|it was a blessing, this was what it was supposed to be!
1414563_a3073485|were you in prison during gdr times, i mean, in the east?
1250721_a3349125|i really got lucky there, and i feel very relieved.
1245356_a2781740|when i went to bulgaria about ten years ago, i visited my mother and we caught up.
1204191_a2787121|everything had to be kept clean and tidy, as if we were in the bundeswehr [german armed forces].
1247205_a2210953|when the meeting was over, i chatted with some of the people for a little while.
1248862_a2788314|i swallowed, followed him and sat down.
1204891_a2760600|then, everyone was free to spend their afternoon as they pleased in the city.
1205821_a2504821|he didn't know if maybe someone of the state security would come over.
1431896_a3000138|at the moment, more and more companies decline the use of an interpreter because it is too expensive.
1178364_a2885264|yes, it was really nice.
1250972_a2771479|that's why we hire a lot of day-wage workers for that department.
1249965-15581230-16013736_a3135979|first i buy the ingredients.
1184536_a2406277|there are differences between the languages.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2804863|it’s changed a little because of the kids.
1431222_a2136337|it was great.
1181838_a2773351|i didn't come to know of it, probably because i can't listen to the news on the radio.
1250972_a2517327|yes, i have to work eight hours.
1582399-11073030-11154047_a2863272|um, what else.
1220195_a2045025|if you don't do it/
1419610-11552205-12003930_a3396026|so it seems we have to wait until he is ready.
1583950_a3250189|so i moved to leipzig.
1290754_a3173424|it was ended.
1247641_a2469245|well.
1210825_a3260506|again i asked what my results where, but still didn’t get an answer.
1184164_a2768315|#name1 was sent to bremen.
1184756_a3096490|it was really great.
1187152_a3074475|i need to babysit on friday, i’m booked there.
1291572_a3912145|so, when they have sex, they belong together.
1583964_a2030357|yes, the restaurant has a semicircular glass facade.
1292770_a2394654|my mother was really anxious.
1249302_a2533176|when the sports club got less and less active, i took up swimming.
1180724_a2522667|and they don't have a replacement.
1177436_a3017611|rarely, right.
1251334_a3173522|i was in the 100-meters relay, you were in the 400-meters relay.
1584545_a2239466|right, the beer.
1431896_a2979819|right, i will talk about the baby topic.
1212218_a2957658|it was the same when traveling with peter scheifele. we told them in advance, and then we still had to worry about it. it was such a struggle.
1419797_a2742293|it is also very exhausting for the hearing people to understand me.
1183917_a2871377|after a bit of searching we ended up finding a good room.
1212218_a2456447|yes, or in general. what’s going on?
1210825_a3128950|everything was about writing and the oral method.
1184536_a2430169|i/
1177860_a3169026|you are sixty.
1182343_a1855936|in school, they get riled up or offended by the boys.
1584545_a2842907|maybe leipziger allerlei [vegetable dish], but i don't eat that a lot.
1250721_a3315200|naturally.
1413251_a2982859|language is a problem, however.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767642|i have a grandson who is nine years old.
1210825_a3280167|i told my girlfriend that in two weeks all that free time would be over.
1211283_a2769861|there are so many opportunities in the deaf world if you only look.
1178364_a2885104|it was too expensive for me. i wasn't able to afford that.
1184536_a2430177|that is good, but what also counts is not just the moment but our children’s and the following generation’s future.
1427810_a3037293|and when we arrive in the evening, we can eat it, the turkey.
1176407_a2882869|you'd rather jump because that would be some sort of liberation. you'd be glad.
1292458_a3025872|they’re far away, one has to go there first and then back again.
1428821-16453820-16510849_a3186777|so, i’m riding my bike when suddenly, i get a flat tire.
1205503_a2736423|there are many emotions, for instance sadness. you can tell somebody's emotions by their facial expressions, such as love or grief.
1211515_a3248174|they told me how much i had grown over the past three month at the boarding school, and how relaxed i seemed.
1177002_a3252602|i’m in favor.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805040|so the ones with a speech defect?
1413251_a3189527|through the english professional skill, one can gather knowledge and perform better.
1292458_a2983253|i can deal with the quiet.
1181455_a2315518|there are no mountains; it's flat land.
1212176_a2779134|
1248699_a2740745|it had never happened before; we had always been quite carefree.
1183203_a3140143|what do you think?
1176340_a2364795|the reason for this was that i didn't want to sit around and be boring.
1204877_a2954660|exactly, i’m the stepbrother.
1419118_a3086855|then the cat takes out a pair of binoculars through wich you can see its big eyes blink.
1183426_a2785064|one of the educators tried to speak with them.
1212176_a2754198|nothing at all? that's bad.
1414312_a2766486|in 1985 the deaflympics were held in l.a., usa.
1183035_a2768586|there's this sign rome, but people used to sign it like that.
1430592_a2265614|“are you bad?“
1209910_a3204841|i ended up in the national team a while ago.
1433655_a2208072|i have two kids.
1181011_a2144477|there is always something happening in that family. they just can't get a rest.
1181455_a2329203|and sometimes, i pay five euros.
1210825_a3264289|i went to the land surveyor’s office instead.
1414503_a3306206|when they noticed that i was deaf, they were shocked.
1292458_a3024035|that’s great.
1583882_a1975458|that was my advantage.
1250972_a2558196|pressure and force measurements? yes, i know what that is.
1290121_a2769281|in the beginning the score was 1:0 for argentina.
1289793_a2980995|yes, exactly.
1182517_a2337470|i was eating really slowly but nevertheless reluctantly.
1177292_a2271142|everyone was stunned by his work; that is how he received most votes.
1429310_a2256650|we were a safe bet. all four of us were really good.
1250646_a3006534|he was relaxing at home when suddenly someone rang the bell. i opened the door and the father was yelling at my husband, telling him to go and vote.
1585089_a3140220|i turned on the tv. boxing started at eleven.
1289793_a2932633|that club, ‘go parc’, there’s typically a lot going on there.
1413238_a3135145|he is annoyed at the telephone, hastily picks it up and answers.
1585089_a3116971|i rode past there and suddenly saw the white smoke.
1212402_a2727047|i didn’t think about it at that time.
1247205_a2212163|that's so funny: with a towel wrapped around. goodness gracious!
1582205_a2046528|who? what's that supposed to mean?
1428475-13374607-13392508_a3229119|the russians don’t work there anymore.
1176340_a2132452|they didn't have a heart for deaf people.
1212176_a2752045|
1246100_a2746093|we became friends.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a3112867|before my kids started school, i told the school what i was expecting from them.
1200691_a2173163|my mother can also read lips.
1583322-12534537-13002913_a2506913|schools for the deaf are incredibly expensive and teachers are being let go for being lazy or because they teach badly.
1418903_a2897628|i/
1245356_a2773459|but it was true.
1177640_a3081022|two baskets are full as you know.
1176846_a2882345|you have/
1210206-12000807-12040142_a2795172|i have no experience like that, but my husband does and he told me about it.
1584411_a2128765|the colors are beautiful, really beautiful.
1206010_a2496739|right. you could consider suggesting a colleagues seminar to your boss.
1210825_a3201222|then the training started.
1419265_a2972143|i just remembered one more really good story.
1419370_a3317940|i’ve been there five times already and it’s truly overwhelming.
1582654_a3103465|but there were no monitors like the passengers have them.
1211752_a2750096|but why shouldn’t we do that for new year’s?
1427725_a2117926|the intelligence is the decisive factor here.
1291572_a2693739|
1181602_a3096318|yes, right.
1212218_a2940116|the one with the tree growing around it?
1244796_a2847987|well, we’ve been forced too much to adapt to the hearing.
1247205_a2212316|i failed to notice it.
1251334_a3167764|i was able to join as well.
1292458_a3028823|they need to, by a state/
1187218_a3191429|if both are high enough, everything is alright.
1210763_a2740129|not really.
1180558-16032848-16050511_a3137465|we decorate everything together.
1584545_a2239407|right.
1291243_a3028125|they let me know via mobile phone, but i didn’t think it was a big deal that they couldn’t come.
1184367_a2577108|but hearing people have more possibilities, because they developed it earlier.
1184536_a2385130|it's easier to speak english.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2299447|no, kassel is located in hesse.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2275022|but i'd have the pratical side with the sports part.
1413251_a3058736|which sign language is the most beautiful?
1429964_a2197795|when i asked what the conversation was about, his only response was, “oh you know, nothing important.”
1431277-12422631-12464143_a3112876|i didn‘t want them to group the children based on their audiograms.
1419931_a2270964|because they always come to talk to you?
1584855_a1994965|and then we were standing there and we were holding the money in our hands.
1584855_a1994962|yes, it went quite fast in the queue.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2785855|since smoking has been banned, the smokers have to cut back.
1183703_a2759218|back then a deaf friend invited me to come.
1204191_a2784487|if a hearing student had made eight or nine mistakes, and i had made only one, i was considered a good student.
1413251_a2975703|the fingerspelling would also have to remain.
1431676_a3248680|those parents might put pressure on their children, but they cannot explain it to their children.
1582654_a3105513|however, he told me i had to figure it out myself.
2021499_a2615119|until then, there had never been a single attack, not one.
1187218_a3121971|i will gather up the courage and start.
1210156-17573900-18041027_a3230753|i had absolutely no clue.
1244796_a3084334|“it’s not important, it is all in the facial expressions and the body language.“ that’s what they told me.
1182062_a2774473|shops used to close earlier, do you remember?
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2896170|i’d be afraid i’d pee my pants.
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3114029|i, so, i/
1245356_a2789681|the second child was born hard of hearing.
1433543_a3024018|schottenhamel?
1248941-12280641-12344740_a2930522|at court/
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2783824|now, i’m not in school anymore.
1211283_a2475662|true, that feels comfortable.
1244796_a3079186|everything i sign is connected to one another and you can quickly grasp the context.
1178364_a2884413|that's how it was. i thought it was too bad.
1177436_a3017629|nothing!
1250966_a2544998|many fled the country, though i, personally, didn't understand why. i never wanted to flee the country.
1244978_a2443016|everyone went outside for the break.
1431690_a2142551|it almost looked like we would go through the water.
1418903_a2899561|i thought that it was too bad anyway.
1431676_a3247528|i was able to explain everything to them.
1290126_a3241750|i was talking to some people, there was quite a lot going on.
1212176_a2751754|i could talk more then.
1292086_a2463159|i was born and raised by a deaf family that used sign language.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1769834|we went to go eat asparagus.
1247205_a2239872|you didn't have to pay anything.
1220195_a2046859|in the u.s., it's like this.
1205568_a2881416|that’s why i tried to get a new job.
1184536_a2479756|what's the source?
1246100_a2784789|that’s what it’s like in india.
1430592_a2267973|i was surrounded by hearing people at work, so that was my balance.
1292125_a2071289|that's why you only saw the feet step by step when getting out.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2933497|
1250972_a2771070|maybe i'll go to the doctor's in one or two years.
1428821-16453820-16510849_a3186894|there’s sandpaper, round and long patches and some glue, as well.
1292770_a2913655|we stayed there for another year, so that life afterwards would be easier for us.
1180546_a3009723|it is a helmet used for riding a bicycle.
1289462_a2398436|without the poison we’d probably be dead already.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2878805|did your conversation get deeper?
1245820_a2868260|it would strengthen the regional association if that person had the chance to win.
1431896_a2989496|there were strict controls at the border.
1204694_a2790426|you care for seniors, i am busy with swimming to keep me healthy, and #name2 is pursuing the goals of the deaf-blind.
1582205_a2039281|it would be an advantage.
1180724_a2680243|the doctor needs information, too.
1584617_a2660059|
1419610-11552205-12003930_a3404882|yesterday i was watching tv.
1249620_a2642614|way more.
1246681_a3261186|they have to pay compensations to poorer states.
1419370_a3425774|but going back to germany might be difficult.
1431224_a2150098|i not only participated in the deaflympics, but also travelled around on my own.
1414563_a3072277|yes, so, i was in prison during that time/
1414503_a2773471|anyhow, my husband went to the hospital.
1180097_a1682137|during my driving test the man said, that/
1180539_a2978318|attention, kindergarten.
1180724_a2678575|we don't care about those things.
1433543_a2985272|that’s why it’s called ‘beer garden‘.
1184145_a2813578|for me, it feels like it is a village.
1583882_a1975415|i like it a lot.
1180254_a2177599|and the other way round, of course. when hearing people watch deaf people, they often think they are fighting. but they are just having a conversation.
1244796_a3082615|the teacher showed the speaking exercise with this movement of the fist for the sound of a p, for grandpa; so it goes “oma” [mouthed with hand under the chin], grandpa, “oma”, grandpa.
1414123_a2755240|wow, that was a long time ago.
1183917_a2873049|there were really only a few things that were broken, phi phi was hit way worse.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a3201590|it probably needed oil.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a2000814|you shouldn't calculate too tightly, that way you’ll deal with poverty.
1414123_a2767920|she's been living there for seven years now.
1183703_a2759226|it kept going like this but then it stopped.
2021499_a2600647|think about it/
1180724_a2680257|the acoustician, the hearing aid acoustician needs information.
1419607_a3409999|the principal there, the principal.
1418903_a2902048|they also criticized that he was gay.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2907345|it is hard to show oneself in public, however.
1178761_a3044518|oh well.
1427810_a2456891|are you allowed to drive under 25?
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2002139|no wait, in the second to last group.
1246772_a3721903|with this certificate you can apply.
1248505_a2747586|while i was breastfeeding my daughter, the anchor from the tagesschau said that diana had died.
1246772_a2388434|i tried teaching again and it worked.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2908583|as a deaf person, i look at the displays, sit down, and wait patiently.
1178364_a2885548|it is called “moral” [morals].
1249542_a2767331|we were there just the four of us but there were also some german groups.
1176846_a2893595|it was nice.
1249951_a2766627|yes, there was a lot of snow back then. just like it was quite snowy a short while ago.
1249620_a2960544|„what, it is a radio? that’s amazing. cool.“, the hearing people answer.
1182517_a2343943|i grew up without parents, therefore i always stayed at the boarding school.
1289462_a2395671|that's hearing people for you. unbelievable.
1583882_a1974992|how much did it cost?
1176846_a2895579|it was nice.
1244796_a2848016|how interesting, though!
1418858_a2944211|exactly, i got distracted as well even though i wanted to pay attention/
1248505_a2756355|isn't it obvious, just look at his face.
1431428_a2542433|that means that i wasn't at the opening but arrived later.
1247205_a2240229|i've been a client of this insurance company for many years now and finally told them that my insurance was getting too expensive.
1180724_a2679760|it helps them and supports them.
1245390_a2782420|no, they sign very fast and finger spell a lot.
1200691_a2171137|in my free time i only meet deaf people, though, and we mostly sign.
1181240-15572825-16003603_a3191806|the smallest daughter sometimes forgets her hearing aids.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2896166|i would like to do it.
1184164_a2768316|yes, that was good.
1433410_a2384197|i told them i was working like everybody else and that is how i am able to travel to egypt.
1211531_a2044643|it was all thanks to the work of helmut kohl.
1178147_a2714035|it was unbelievable in cologne.
1418903_a2897476|yes, that's true.
1245356_a2774698|right, there is this one saying in bulgaria, “the truth lies in the red wine.“
1427725_a2098021|it changed in that way that women showed there was such a thing called fashion.
1419265_a2974075|at some point, another woman sees the woman making out with the man in the café.
1246329_a2763623|
1584198_a3280726|it does not usually happen with others, but sometimes we do have to scold our daughter.
1182343_a1855933|they are rather at home and have their peace.
1178939_a3040534|something is missing. the interpreter would have to be a teacher themselves.
1247641_a2723157|he doesn't pay anything.
1211752_a2942481|now, it’s probably high, because i’m warm.
1584329-15450503-15475829_a3186914|before that, i get back into the driver’s seat and put on the handbrake, that’s important.
1205168_a2741469|right.
1585089_a3107072|i looked at the time again and suddenly it was already over, after four or five rounds.
1584545_a2842824|i didn't visit it at all!
1418858_a2949208|i’ve booked a musician recently.
1292458_a3024502|it is in other countries, it’s more extreme there.
1250279_a3002796|they can’t help me.
1413251_a3059585|possibly, yes.
1212218_a2957674|or do you have to replace it with one with those fingerprints? no?
1212416_a2480654|we then strolled around somewhere else.
1245820_a2871126|i can do it myself, because i have the right to be freed of all barriers when watching tv.
1582654_a3109947|now there‘s a bridge, but it didn‘t exist back then.
1433543_a2980867|the stachus, i mean the karlsplatz [large square in central munich, official name karlsplatz, stachus as unofficial name widely used].
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1769835|we go on a trip once a year.
1290581_a2934146|yes, the heat and the sweating were bad.
1292768_a2386616|we went to my mom together.
1291572_a2693794|and you obey and read one book right after the other.
1431428_a2542694|it was really great for the young people there.
1182062_a2775373|unfortunately i didn’t.
1291164_a3115098|i have really never drunk any alcohol.
1250279_a3003320|and now i need them because of my health.
1427114-10034345-10053342_a2260602|the table was a teacher's desk, but i didn't care.
1584545_a2256921|it tastes really good with the milk in it.
1413925_a3427562|i still feel a bit afraid.
1429310_a2253200|i prefer team sports.
1250646_a3022272|it’s true!
1430592_a2269498|but i wasn’t payed as a master, i always stayed a little below that wage.
1205503_a2728292|in the beginning, their eyes aren't open yet. they don't actively take in their surroundings right on the first day of being born.
1427725_a2113083|they have the same style.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3289324|deaf people from all over the world came together to watch the soccer games.
1212611_a2780767|the teacher understood that, agreed and i sat back down.
1431676_a3247573|i somehow have it in me.
1182801_a1943391|i signed something ahead of time that is older.
1584198_a2659975|where, in bautzen, bautzen?
1178939_a3038355|
1430832_a2689030|yes, yes, i know it!
1247525_a2531433|thanks to a good friend of mine i was introduced to water polo.
1177436_a3017506|i already told them.
1246100_a2726689|the goal in germany should be to make deafness normal.
1180254_a2177587|they look angry, but what they tell you is okay.
1418858_a2943872|i went three times.
1584855_a1993603|he pointed at another car and said that that one was a great car with a lot of power compared to my trabant, which was scrap.
1430396_a3267665|i stayed until the sixth grade and then left.
1431690_a2244959|there might have been 100,000 or 500,000 citizens affected then and left without any electricity.
1183203_a3127060|it‘s neither the child‘s nor the mother‘s fault.
1210997_a2742451|back then, i saw such thing for the first time. it was beautiful to watch; i was stunned.
1205503_a2738172|all babies died after two or three years.
1292458_a3023951|yes.
1419610-11552205-12003930_a3389011|i don’t know. well, let’s put all that aside for a moment.
1184089_a2773027|yes, she died young.
1291892_a2156918|the u.s. also has many people/
1292458_a2986684|i basically grew up here, it’s okay.
1414563_a2988421|well, oral/
1212402_a2725730|my parents already had some experience with this kindergarten because i have a brother who is deaf.
1211515_a3240061|we had to hurry because of the time.
1204691_a2770438|everybody complains, but they shouldn’t need to.
1430396_a3268939|nobody had told me, i had no idea. so of course i was a bit sad.
1418903_a2911271|when i was young, i went to the 3000 really often.
1177702_a2975719|that’s just how it is.
1248400_a2741360|they were scared to loose the trust if they extended the usage for another ten years and therefore they revised their decision.
1250721_a3349365|we were 20 people, and those of us who were too old were dismissed.
1176340_a2187657|that's why i contributed to the conversation and talked.
1212218_a2964890|it’s stressful for me if it’s more than that.
1182062_a2775295|it takes place every three years at different locations.
1205821_a2492535|and the magic show!
1419607_a3395534|the child ended up getting a ci anyway.
1181011_a2144090|a whole term lasts four years, right?
1290126_a3233372|looking back at it now, it’s nice to see there was so much support over there.
1431690_a2142467|there was a deaf person/
1205503_a2772654|that's super intersting.
1585089_a3838458|you’d be okay with that?
1419607_a3407735|the others started to be annoyed by me, because i kept interrupting the classes again and again.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2394607|but for instance/
1430396_a3267973|no, i already had a feeling for it.
1290754_a3171542|i have been criticized once, i asked that person to leave.
1205568_a2885050|the society had to save money, hire cheap workers and they only had one zivildienstleistender [worker in alternative civilian service in lieu of conscription; since 2011 changed to federal volunteers service; following: volunteer].
1177860_a3754748|that‘s not really a concern of mine.
1249376_a2842774|other countries, like france or the czech republic, also have nuclear power plants.
1290126_a3238676|the german government stays out of it; they’re smart.
1584617_a3269462|
1211752_a2938152|there was a steep drop next to me.
1247525_a2531020|tennis.
1248862_a2783951|he said, ”you can’t see properly, right?”
1431224_a2153764|you couldn't compare it to new zealand.
1585089_a2475047|i don’t know, just that if he has his surprise day, then yes.
1430396_a3267980|because of the soccer, i travel a lot internationally.
1428907-11590941-12015445_a2429209|
1433543_a3026742|the important thing is that it tastes good.
1184089_a2760560|yes, i remember it well.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3157911|no, before that/
1183426_a2910874|i see. that's why.
1248505_a2747804|he didn't really say anything publicly.
1181455_a2302582|the slippers were filled with grains.
1249951_a2766102|i've already talked about it.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787521|what’s your opinion to that?
1246772_a2388801|i think the information was on taubenschlag [a german homepage for the deaf].
1182062_a2773299|it's getting better.
1431222_a2139531|exactly.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787525|yes, that’s getting less.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1779869|i was asked if the two of us wanted to found a motorcycle club.
1413925_a2817503|i have to be careful with that topic.
1584617_a2660048|
1433543_a3025770|he comes from the country and eats his weisswurst with his hands, just like me.
1249620_a2618662|deaf people should be supported the way they are.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2819214|i asked one of them, if he couldn’t just throw away the ci then. he laughed and said, “no, no.“
1432043_a2966870|yes.
1430628_a2126032|probably because of the world cup, i guess.
1184145_a2813495|but about 30 or 40 km further, in bayreuth, the weather is beautiful.
1289462_a2397925|where else to put it? where?
1413925_a3408204|
1205503_a2769696|when you are alone and you don't feel any caressing, you feel lonely.
1433543_a2981046|we forgot about the oktoberfest.
1183203_a3150110|later on, he sat in the car with his mother and was able to point at differently colored things outside and show the respective sign for each color.
1289623_a2511193|it was just a great get-together.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2884791|that too.
1177860_a3203076|i have to admit, that’s a clever proposal.
1181838_a2774386|so he noticed that something was wrong in the cockpit.
1430590_a2259249|that's the way it was.
1245356_a2785572|those are two strong bonds.
1250279_a2941049|t-e-s-s?
1430592_a2265912|they would hit our hands with a stick, there were beatings when we were stubborn.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2820561|they can decide for themselves.
1291636_a3095973|they took out the bodies and put them in a tub.
1427725_a2098592|
1176846_a2893144|then, two days later i met my neighbor.
1246772_a2810325|that's enough; i don't need more people.
1428905_a2428978|
1292125_a2071834|that's why i have my doubts.
1292458_a3176998|it’s called city/ rural exodus.
1183203_a3160773|later, when the child goes to school it will learn to form those sentences.
1248625-15324720-15465943_a2777345|if you ride your bike in the countryside, you can see cows everywhere.
1413251_a2975709|sure, yes.
1585089_a3127961|there, back again, done.
1177860_a3203053|then i showed it to my boss.
1429910-16075041-16115817_a3075840|everything goes into a carton.
1427810_a3041638|is it a nice city?
1177860_a3189445|now it’s winter, it’s cold, and i have to go outside/
1182343_a1857507|when we were for instance talking about how to get a fax, i didn't get how it worked.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2819312|but to me, being deaf is better, because i can be free, so to speak.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2894747|it is also not permitted to go skydiving.
1249376_a2841842|that’s how i knew about it.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767651|he does so openly without being ashamed or afraid.
1181455_a2894961|they go daily every 30 minutes.
1582439_a2020953|in her opinion, children need to be raised strictly.
1250972_a2508874|i simply couldn't do it. i couldn't.
1292125_a2071729|the moon remains in position when it circles the earth.
1210206-12000807-12040142_a2795092|but with the pope, i watched for one or two minutes and then fled.
1429310_a2261446|that was in 1995.
1181159_a3223917|sure, as a child you‘re young and silly.
1291572_a2615065|she told me all those things and i listened.
1427810_a3037216|the mincemeat isn’t a problem.
1292458_a3057701|it used to look like a pyramid.
1180724_a2904905|but is there a reason for that?
1180254_a2175613|no.
1427725_a2097901|but that's not the case.
1212176_a2751558|that's good.
1180546_a3009713|that is true, helmets for motorcycles have a visor. you are right.
1177640_a3080902|the man is still picking pears in the tree, while the boy is laughing in his sleeve and disappearing.
1583950_a3259174|there’s two.
1291243_a2379339|so the white ring helped her.
1249542_a2759409|there were a lot of lectures/
1211283_a2475633|yes, the internet.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2195638|it is really to be recommended.
1245390_a2774273|and my three sculptures were put up in the auditorium of gallaudet university.
1431896_a2984856|that is true.
1181027_a2169850|really well done, absolutely no boring or dry film.
1291572_a2693701|i see, good.
1183426_a2785071|when an educator told me how loud i screamed, i was surprised. horrible.
1178939_a3039121|i can imagine it like that, too.
1220195_a2040433|the parents can't be bothered to learn signs for their kids.
1178939_a3023081|it’d be best if everyone knew how to finger spell, or the basics of sign language.
1181838_a2897964|then there was the second hit.
1249951_a2766084|they worried about me and frequently sent messages.
1427725_a2098916|
1583043_a1861578|they didn't need so much as a mutual opinion, but rather a mutual consent on a position.
1184367_a2568160|that's why it's an interesting story.
1204239_a3078385|that’s what it was like back in the day, but nowadays, it doesn’t happen anymore.
1204694_a2790933|i do have a car, though.
1245356_a2785627|i saw it. well, ok.
1248400_a2713866|the elections are every four years.
1178364_a2888596|there is also a christmas bazaar in hamburg.
1419931_a2254810|you used to put it in a bread roll to eat it.
1427810_a2456773|yes, one with cream.
1245462_a2382023|then i will travel to another european country and ask for the meaning of , for example, the different spanish signs.
1427810_a2456803|that‘s good, i think.
1204239_a3069568|two women come from there.
1177292_a2198991|among those who participated in the contest, the person whose signed expressions were the clearest received the award “die goldene hand” [golden hand].
1245390_a3911913|asking whether it was #name1 or #name2.
1291636_a3095774|that meant that there was a fluid inside the bomb.
1210208_a2796658|it costs a lot of money.
1244796_a3079122|then i realized that everyone has their own language.
1179224_a3275421|it varies.
1178939_a3036822|that’d be better, right?
1583882_a1976830|i've signed it like this so far because i didn't know the real sign for it.
1178133_a2899774|he wanted to show me how high the water level in dresden actually was.
1291892_a2074254|if a japanese person collected pictures as a hobby, they were all gone.
1430590_a2256692|she went to euskirchen.
2025500_a3274614|that‘s really cheap.
1250059_a2496967|yet, people who commented negatively on the stasi - who, for example, insulted members or protested against it - were arrested immediately.
1177860_a3198995|they are a bit sleepy.
1413451-11171532-11201836_a2863779|after gambling, we used to party at the club all night long until early in the morning. then we went to bed.
1178939_a2977884|i just stayed within my own ‘ghetto‘.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2001745|she answered using signing exact german, but she knew sign language, as well.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1786152|good.
1430592_a2267042|when i graduated i moved.
1582841_a1782265|it was hard and far away.
1178364_a2882692|
1250646_a3097018|there was chicken meat/
1292545_a2517719|it's common to have a special program for christmas.
1292458_a3031830|they complain about the little things.
1247525_a2529255|that's also fun.
1584545_a2284760|oh sure! right, the saxon switzerland!
1429781-13002707-13070302_a2366674|i only found out about that today, when the moderator explained it.
1181240-15572825-16003603_a3191959|i wave goodbye, the children get on and drive off.
1210825_a3189697|i said okay and let her take me there.
1433543_a2980856|i don’t really know what i’m supposed to say about the surrounding area of my home.
2021499_a2614879|but there was no help from above.
1246772_a2810421|but it has already started.
1177002_a3285448|it works for maybe ten out of, what do i know, seventy, or a hundred.
1419370_a3282458|he said communication assistants were crap and that he’d like to get rid of them.
1419931_a2273597|ah really? i didn’t know.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2002064|you had to sit there well-behaved and pay attention.
1419118_a3086862|so you see these big blinking eyes.
1433543_a3031961|and it’s fresh, cold water.
1583964_a2030327|i experienced that once.
1211531_a2819093|if the wall were still up, we would have saved a lot of money.
1181397_a2256315|yet, he had been lying there for almost half an hour.
1583964_a2021436|i was afraid of the flooding.
1209910_a3085827|so now there’s two.
1290581_a3243777|when the first plate was empty, i noticed that there was coming more.
1181011_a2145452|it is possible that there was not only one but three shooters.
1414563_a3030637|i told them there were several reasons, for example, first, i’m deaf, second, i’m not a spy, and also, i wanted to be free.
1290581_a3243715|the islands are very hilly, just like/
1211283_a2766718|i take my hat off to that person and the work that has been done.
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3033775|to-upholster.
1250721_a3347050|there was another assessment of my condition, but the application was rejected again.
1181011_a2144401|it seems like death is bound to happen.
1209077_a2254975|they succeed with their studies, they are smart.
1212611_a2779155|i didn’t understand why signing in class wasn’t allowed.
1177436_a3180719|we do have to talk about all the topics!
1180556_a2613509|there is no such thing as environmental friendly diesel at the time.
1209910_a2983775|yes.
1290581_a2938064|i was really disappointed.
1200691_a2173212|communication doesn't work and there's rarely a warm atmosphere among them.
1181027_a2169916|in berlin.
1291636_a3090292|that’s because next to the school, there was also a big administration building that was also part of the school.
1182062_a2778485|it was april.
1248090_a2699598|whatever. they signed close-door.
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3114042|not two.
1248090_a2699590|that‘s right.
1247849_a2791429|my brother-in-law said, “quiet! quiet!” and i asked him what's wrong.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2814253|we had jam.
1584545_a2256920|do you also know/ i mean, noodles are known everywhere, but we make our tomato sauce differently. we make it more light-toned by adding milk.
1245820_a2862785|let's leave maternity leave aside.
1431222_a2139395|i remember that there was a heated discussion about it.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2783648|deaf people are more open to asking others, for example how to get to the swimming pool or something like that.
1183203_a3150072|so, then #name2 started learning sign language.
1182801_a1941776|i think it is better to go to work.
1204691_a2847221|oh, be happy.
1211283_a2769827|i went to the training because you can chat with others there.
1414503_a2773632|why do deaf people have to suffer because police and fire department don’t arrive reliably?
1177436_a3142002|right.
1418903_a2897443|but this time, he didn't want to go, he wasn't feeling well that week. but he wanted to do so the week after.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767619|when you were twenty, that young!
1220195_a2042766|one time, we drove around and suddenly saw a big crowd of hearing people meeting for a motorcycle convention.
1204691_a2836966|the first president was jochen muhs.
1585089_a3120576|after that, there have been some modifications.
1419370_a3319607|he got better and better at his job and everything worked out fine.
1220195_a2041230|they ask the doctor what to do.
1178939_a2982033|what do you think about integration in an educational context?
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2294007|there is a lot going on.
1200689_a2169579|no.
1184089_a2764403|unfortunately, she married the wrong man.
1180097_a1708979|you brake the back wheel with the foot brake. you have to use the handbrake additionally, so you brake with both.
1248400_a2744770|or until he dies, or, er, says good-bye and passes the position on to his son.
1210208_a2796623|after all, they have three rivers joining which benefits a fast rise of the water.
1177860_a3191022|but i/
1183203_a3150063|the father thought about it and decided that he wanted #name2 to grow up bilingually.
1179868_a2873194|hey, look at me.
1584198_a3703949|it’s still the same machine, but it’s slowly wearing out.
1583882_a2876991|but you weren't able to text anyone with those cell phones yet.
1247205_a2238634|i'll leave it up to my insurance company.
1178133_a2899842|and more and more came.
1184536_a2479580|when i got what they meant, it was a new experience for me. something new.
1181159_a3225371|ever since first starting my apprenticeship, i‘ve observed that group sizes go down quickly.
1180254_a2175743|they wanted to teach in an oral way.
1583964_a2030373|yes, he told me that he could take my bike, as well.
1582205_a2558222|in some professions they succeeded in equalizing.
1583322-12534537-13002913_a2535885|mr #name1 was insolent.
1249542_a2931429|
1250721_a3348625|great.
1184756_a2458258|but the face looks so similar.
1182343_a1924081|that much about arts, one of my favourite subjects in school.
1433410_a2904766|not me.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2179256|festivities? actually, there are only two.
1184756_a3118437|i rather staggered, i was that drunk.
1247641_a2715129|unfortunately, it is my decision.
1184367_a2561010|you can walk to the ultimate end of the wall , and the eyes would still look at you.
1187154_a3120934|
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3289373|so we discussed it.
1210156-17573900-18041027_a3230976|there were incredibly many deaf people from different groups, and everyone chatted.
1290754_a3173460|it’s gotten less at the moment.
1247205_a2211538|one on the other car, and one on my car.
1429310_a2253187|i stayed for a year but then it wasn't as much fun for me anymore.
1250972_a2961248|for instance in architectural technology you had to have a b.
1248862_a2781693|when the plays were done, the people went outside and left the jury to discuss their decision in peace.
1184749_a2780976|that's why i went to new zealand from there.
1184749_a2779243|we sign and when i don't know how to go on, i say, “wait a second, i have to pause.” the sign/
1210997_a2738037|but, other than that/
1430592_a2269506|many wanted to get their orders fast, but i had to put them off from day to day because i couldn’t do it as quickly.
1182517_a2335791|my school days in schwäbisch gmünd weren't the best.
1582205_a2046530|what else?
1431896_a2980437|it doesn’t matter if the child is hearing or deaf. it is worthy of living.
1211752_a2748203|wait!
1419265_a2973010|but they agree that it must be clear for the affair that the other partner is married and will want to remain married.
1413232_a3115218|it happily swings back and forth.
1177860_a3021134|true, it will be difficult for the deaf people.
1249951_a2768637|everything worked out well, and i arrived at the city.
1204694_a2791059|i no longer take the steep and fast slopes descending from the peak, and i also don’t go downhill while chasing one another anymore.
1212218_a2958601|he will visit me in the summer.
1245356_a2981261|it was just superficial, nothing more.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3157054|it was basically just a square.
1205821_a2492505|controllers were standing at the wall.
1429964_a2695473|i explained a lot to her.
1184536_a2430178|but that’s okay.
1431896_a2989198|i was surprised about that. it was just like the spelling from west germany from a long time ago.
1183720-17021701-17054739_a2757230|there was zero support.
1180097_a1707884|and then the usual procedure followed: buckling the belt, adjusting the side mirrors, etc. just the usual. release of the handbrake, buckling on.
1290581_a2936009|yes, when you’re sunburned you’re supposed to apply compresses with baby powder, that helps, everything is gone the next day.
1180254_a2929082|but i realized that he had to earn money for our family, so he was unfortunately rarely at home.
1204694_a2790740|really difficult.
1433543_a2980916|the nymphenburg palace.
1177918_a2874701|“after all, it has been up and running for many years now.”
1419931_a2270589|what else?
1177702_a2871403|i like it that way.
1432043_a3042695|it can get quite hot, then it’ll rain again.
1247525_a2529265|but at the moment i am not playing a lot.
1246681_a3899719|
1431224_a2153767|i knew my father-in-law would have a lot to rave about when he was back.
1179212_a2880771|yes, i wanted to add to that.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2959611|at first, #name7 wanted to take it easy, too. yet, when he first started sending out applications, no one wanted to hire him, and now he’s stuck.
1584329-15450503-15475829_a3192021|then i lower the car again.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767660|
1584545_a2199936|they built the lower pedestal first and then the one on top.
1184367_a2568323|i still ask myself how i would have coped without captions.
1248699_a2749641|they wanted to secure one of the other ones, because of the radioactivity.
1583043_a1856154|he also has a brother who is hard of hearing.
1181159_a3147349|that‘s the reason.
1427810_a3086826|with spätzle?
1176846_a2890688|#name1 was driving.
1428905_a2864264|yes.
1212402_a2772131|the master craftswoman opened the door and asked me what was wrong but i didn't know either.
1250972_a2766543|that means i worked as part of a job creation plan for a year.
1244742_a2479399|the city tour was interesting and i liked it.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787960|once, when i was still younger, i wanted to try smoking.
1209910_a3086059|when we were there, we had a goal.
1583214_a1858802|it was my second son's fault.
1248090_a2699696|yes, please.
1292458_a3057729|they’re still debating that today.
1251334_a3015940|you can talk about it.
1431676_a3248649|that‘s great for those who can hear, but what about the deaf people?
1212611_a2785926|but i don’t really show anything from inside.
1414503_a2934150|he couldn’t go on anymore, i tried to get him to the elevator as fast as i could, with my mother helping me.
1584198_a3228760|i thought, right, that is not too bad, i do not know that movie, but i know similar ones so it is okay.
1427725_a2113038|
1585089_a3101817|yesterday, the striker/
1182062_a2772593|my son and i went there by train last week.
1176340_a2187549|i could talk about my time in schleswig.
1177436_a3180407|that was really typical of the deaf people - they wanted to keep the wall.
1289462_a2396214|it doesn’t work with only one of them.
1182801_a1944038|he was able to work a little on the side because he was still very agile.
1187218_a3191748|goulash soup and stuff like that.
1414123_a2767785|he was bragging about it.
1290754_a3171130|it went pretty well the entire time, then there was a change and i took over as first chairman.
1418858_a2927613|of course you do! they are celebrities from munich: thow show!
1430328_a2174626|the standard of life is great and there are great cultural offers.
1178364_a2892479|that was nice. but it's sad that i can't see the next play in march in kiel.
1414563_a3902582|then/
1209309-13425110-13472919_a2792414|it’s always overcrowded there.
1181455_a2302348|there's a casino inside.
1211752_a2755749|do you already feel like having lunch?
1246329_a2763527|i looked around outside, because i needed fresh air.
1250972_a2588844|at some point my doctor said to me that i really needed to stop working and turn in the papers because i would endanger the health of my baby.
1176846_a2893996|i wanted my mother to have a nice time and i wanted to spend time with her.
1212611_a2786024|he was a topic for heated discussions.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3275076|i asked if they had any space left, no matter how much it‘d cost, i’d pay because i needed it.
1290126_a3218741|they say germany has a strong economical growth. economy wise, it’s going quite well.
1428821-16453820-16510849_a3190757|that’s why one should make a mental note of where it was before.
1250972_a2484031|yes, down south close to frankfurt at the main.
1210825_a3264298|i can tell you, i didn’t even know the word ‘mathematics’, didn’t know what it was.
1248505_a2757041|who knows!
1211283_a2769223|well, they asked me to do it, 'your german writing skills are good, please work in our team.‘
1585089_a3122131|it includes the formula three.
1247205_a2827762|that one didn't get in touch with me.
1177860_a3021191|there’s fibreglass on the inside.
1205503_a2850706|exactly.
1290996-15110219-15155045_a2087879|he shot him from the top of a roof.
1182801_a1941817|the stock exchange is not my strongest suit. i don't like it a lot and it doesn't fascinate me.
1433410_a2383012|we were at the sign language festival in berlin or other events.
1179224_a3274152|the sheep can graze off all the budding birch trees as well.
1181397_a2252706|a wall?
1184756_a3119710|i heard that they’ll also clash with the dates of the hessian culture days.
1292770_a2394160|i was happy about it, and i grit my teeth and worked hard.
1289462_a2398208|when they close the nuclear power station, and no one obtains energy from it anymore, we have to turn to other providers.
1432043_a3420172|there’s the highway a/
1179224_a3272255|it went all the way from there to the alster, it was really unbelievable.
1583964_a2866124|exactly.
1428038_a2864472|yes, it's that way.
1413925_a2804702|the green party is happy now.
1419607_a3395581|i asked whether it really did help.
1419607_a3414627|i also said, that i would like for all schools to take on that system in the future.
1182343_a1856822|the foam spread everywhere.
1181159_a3218771|some students really wanted to go home, others, however, wanted to stay.
1182801_a2840561|this set off a chain reaction, which in turn caused for other banks in the world to collapse.
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3053770|i don’t sign it like that.
1210208_a2796630|in ilzstadt they built high walls.
1246772_a2388690|do you know how much it costs?
1583950_a3250143|because i wasn’t a boarding student i was going forth and back between home and school, so i only spent the days with them.
1210825_a3187943|i had trouble answering.
1419610-11552205-12003930_a3422975|it was the devil’s work.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805006|that’s true.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787532|the doctor warned her and recommended she stop smoking.
1204691_a2787279|those were the differences.
1427368_a3243288|then i find one but the appointment doesn’t work for her.
1431982_a3082414|he makes his way back home with his son.
1582399-11073030-11154047_a2741268|anyway, our thoughts are with our mother.
1428472_a3219077|oh right, my topic is the ci.
1179224_a3020516|so, that’s your hometown?
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2777437|later on, i went to a boarding school at first.
1429964_a2730401|45 minutes per trip.
1431896_a2996216|the houses were renovated and look very colorful now.
1290581_a2934083|i could swim there, enjoy the sun and relax.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a3028065|because a swede, for example, would have to learn german if he came here.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2819016|i caught him, as a deaf person.
1248699_a2740052|we didn't know it was happening.
1427725_a2118227|so they can really differentiate between them.
1430328_a2180039|i showed them around a little.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3285799|i slept in a bunk bed with a curtain to pull around it.
1180556_a2556764|weird.
1291572_a2771305|at some point later on, i didn't worry about it any longer.
1246772_a2387195|i told her it is available online.
1250061-12113327-12180631_a2615362|they kept outbidding each other.
1430396_a3267704|so you were done with istanbul and moved here.
1245154-15360102-15384713_a3075158|it turns into a firm, red mixture.
1184089_a2760628|did the driver die?
1248941-12280641-12344740_a2930580|they are free at the doctor’s office, at work, at state offices, and at the court.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3159054|they also sell new clothing items.
1292770_a2912504|the examiner had a stopwatch to time us.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1779642|them and me/
1432043_a3030073|yes.
1250966_a2545563|i met them again some time later, there they told me about it.
1584855_a1995156|i was really pissed off.
1205503_a2753589|then you say, “wait a second, i have to feed my baby really quick.”
1413251_a2975618|what would be a disadvantage?
1249376_a2841799|that’s what i was thinking about.
1419607_a3407672|people there believe that one does not need sign language interpreters.
1211752_a2623793|but who do you want to invite?
1250059_a2478199|i let her describe it to me thoroughly - everything that happened, how it worked, and what it looked like.
1291243_a2379169|there is an exhibition, the apartment of a victim of violence, that you can look at.
1413925_a2817276|there were no mobile phones back then.
1204694_a2789513|even if the person smells bad, has strong breath and stinks of sweat.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2398061|compensation for/
1583043_a1856232|i wasn't a member of any party back then.
1984189_a3228838|at first, you see a lot of houses.
1178133_a2892942|the rest, not as much.
1211752_a2744616|doesn’t matter.
1182062_a2774623|no one wanted to tear down the old building, as it’s landmarked.
1178147_a2720387|it was unfortunate.
1180556_a2684773|first, the taxes were supposed to be reduced quickly.
1210825_a3187292|when it was time to eat, i always cut the line, and the others looked at me weirdly.
1209077_a2251851|there need to be a few deaf people together, of course.
1204691_a2773406|i am happy about the way it is.
1244978_a2433330|i used to play tricks in class with my coda friend, the one on the high level.
1428472_a3228323|it’s bad now.
1428907-11590941-12015445_a2773464|unbelievable.
1210763_a2575197|what about you?
1428225_a2155388|i think, i was three years old, but my memory doesn't go that far back.
1250279_a2941939|if one has issues because of debt, problems at work, has to go to the doctor/
1205821_a2492150|her parents didn't know what to do.
1177436_a3180276|that’s it.
1212218_a3012795|i like to busy myself with the topic of history.
1246329_a2763420|a little later, i suddenly had to go to the hospital.
1212218_a2996331|what if the deaf person doesn’t know you well, though? what about that?
1290126_a3241646|their opinion about the future matters to me.
1290126_a3238868|i have a good relationship with the neighbour living on the floor below me.
1289462_a2397901|i really hate that.
1184367_a2569538|today, he's well-known everywhere.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2814328|very simple.
1204877_a2933114|sometimes on the weekends i went swimming in the stream with my brother.
1250972_a2766154|afterwards, i went back to work.
1428475-13374607-13392508_a3229075|no, because of the crack.
1248400_a2852952|via text message/
1249741_a2785093|everything slowly starts to blossom.
1178768_a1995359|hearing people got him easily. he was just great.
1433410_a2382461|i'm living a normal life; just not in the hearing world, but in the deaf world.
1210825_a3285320|i picked up a few other interesting things as well.
1430590_a2259301|were the classes in school good?
1419931_a2245425|there used to be a wall around berlin so it was like an island.
1428472_a3219772|you sign and are merry.
1584855_a1991908|i knew nothing.
1200691_a2244877|he was good-hearted.
1290126_a3241220|somebody moved in next to us back then.
1428472_a3219274|it should have stayed in germany.
1419265_a2971898|that’s really tough.
1248090_a2695653|he was sent there; it was great!
1250972_a2771318|i wouldn't be able to move from one city to another just like that.
1413451-11105600-11163240_a2834886|i had to take classes in math and german, and things like that.
1249302_a2540136|once in hanover and another time in hildesheim.
1428907-11590941-12015445_a2773483|
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2195618|and the “bürgerpark”.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2283234|we are 24 years apart then.
1290126_a3241327|it was only after that whole procedure that one finally received the car keys.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3162052|those young girls nowadays enjoy knitting less and less.
1419607_a3417101|as i said, i was not there myself.
1177860_a3195852|it’s difficult to say.
1414312_a2772086|both of them worked very hard.
1289793_a2958716|that’s what i said.
1209077_a2251718|that's right, but when they're already growing up like that, it's easier.
1212611_a2781667|i asked my tutor where my piece of paper was.
1204877_a2952712|that’s it.
1204891_a2759038|we greeted him friendly and asked if he was working in this bar.
1178768_a1995415|it was not that he was so vague that i didn't know what he meant.
1583950_a3250793|so, i stayed there for only one year and then went back to leipzig.
1413925_a3427620|i didn‘t see it.
1583882_a2876979|not bad that you can see the text on a display.
1413925_a2817244|i was very surprised then that the wall had fallen, as was my neighbour #name4.
1212611_a2781737|i greeted the tutor back coolly.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2992719|we turned a blind eye to the information on the tickets and tried to get through the entrance of the south stand.
1582654_a2659425|the hotel room was freezing, too. it was on average eleven or twelve degrees in the room.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3151706|they even get printed.
1182135_a2749559|that's great.
1204694_a2789707|there’s a lot going on, he’s relaxed and casual, i like that.
1419931_a2262685|are you going?
1291572_a2564898|he said that we were in germany, not in japan.
1431676_a3250645|how interesting.
1247849_a2821288|it’s not any better here in germany.
1182801_a1940771|wine used to cost ten mark.
1244742_a2481451|the forth event also took place in frankfurt.
1181455_a2302349|i also like that there are so many huge mountains in baden-baden.
1584545_a2248434|like you would roll the dumplings in your armpit?
1432043_a3042917|that was nice.
1431428_a2986606|it depends on the students who are currently in my class.
1180556_a2556138|no. the energy-saving light bulbs can't move.
1179224_a3260672|very many, that’s true. some of them were hidden.
1248400_a2756205|if they send it back they don't know which tooth it will eventually go on.
1184367_a2582338|they had to carry heavy things.
1211752_a2743989|because now that i think about it, i usually always go visit my friends in heilbronn.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a3105932|that’s were the training centers are.
1431676_a3250592|eventually, they‘ll hire someone for us.
1247525_a2529039|but especially this and last year it was really cold.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2933257|you parents are hearing, as well?
1177436_a3017663|unfortunately that’s the case.
2025500_a3264388|however, i actually received a lot of approval and honors back then.
1249620_a2597514|when he or she grows up/
1210206-12000807-12040142_a2795159|no, i don’t really know about that.
1585089_a2475059|yes, definitely. i’ve been to the lausitzring before.
1290121_a2769963|so only one of them, the man or the woman, was allowed to go to the matches.
1584855_a1993391|at that time, the motorways in the gdr were brutal; it was such a bumpy ride.
1246681_a3261006|b-a-s-f used to have a huge chemistry factory in ludwigshafen.
1248625-15324720-15465943_a2969758|they have a beer fest there once a year around june and july.
1419931_a2255285|right.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2804934|start an apprenticeship.
1180724_a2522690|the batteries, everything is paid for.
1180556_a2556463|yes, but the regular light bulbs won't be on market for much longer. how will that work out then?
1177640_a3079926|suddenly, a man with a stubborn goat arrives.
1180724_a2692917|not the doctor, but the doctor's assistant.
1429781-13002707-13070302_a2366554|oh no, the wife doesn’t get left out.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1779600|aurich.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2905151|one day, the following happened:
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1778529|i didn't have trouble reading her lips.
1212176_a2752123|yes, because of its shape.
1184536_a3907065|the situation in schools for the deaf is as follows:
1292458_a3028987|my parents have a house, yes.
1427368_a3243483|then i know that he translates the whole content for me.
1246772_a2388698|during that time we read, study etc. on our own.
1247205_a2827447|in the past, i had/
1178939_a3041020|that way they’d have a better chance, that’s right.
1427810_a3035628|everything was prepared.
1292125_a2065365|it was quite an experience for me.
1205503_a2850591|but wait, listen.
1427810_a3033132|no, that’s better.
1414312_a2771669|so i thought, “these are supposed to be the deaflympics?”
1181455_a2302342|about how much is it?
1205568_a2954779|my mother was someone who dreamt a lot, a permanent dreamer.
1418858_a2929695|i forgot what it was called.
1212218_a3030725|the upcoming destination is india. you can look at the different activities they offer. it’s quite interesting.
1289462_a2397509|you can only sit at home then.
1181602_a3086397|we often played games or did different activities, like playing basketball outside together.
1204191_a2816266|i had to choose between painter and tailor.
1246102_a2815549|every time i came home from boarding school, i explained the new signs i had learned and what weird and different signs were used at boarding school.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3148435|according to the english pattern. i didn‘t know what it meant.
1291243_a2381671|you can’t really see it.
1176340_a2358035|well, i‘ve thought of something, and i‘ll tell you something about a rather “bad” story.
1244796_a3084262|the sign to-wail i now articulate at the hand.
1184756_a3101587|we continued drinking and writing to each other.
1248699_a2752871|no one wants the radioactive contamination, so where are we to put the waste?
1584855_a1997948|i asked for the price of the new alternator. i don't remember the price anymore.
1181027_a2907025|then/
1245820_a2867555|yet, a plea is futile.
1245820_a2871101|the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities states it really clearly.
1178939_a3035786|that’s where the teenagers are, but at the schools for the hearing kids, the mainstream schools, there are also incredible amounts of hearing-impaired students.
1433410_a2384428|in the evening the travel guide explained what the group would do the next day.
1414563_a3098423|in leipzig, they firstly trained mechanics, secondly, carpenters, then, painters, and the fourth/
1182343_a1851656|it started three years ago.
1212176_a2754030|my father told me that he will show me his work in his firm soon.
1200689_a2169547|people are thankful for my assistance, but i also explain to them that it can't always go like this.
1210208_a2796602|that group of deaf people went there but i didn’t have the time to join them.
1181011_a2145441|there were three shooters?
1180724_a2692643|that is the first thing.
1181159_a3218738|they at times tweaked your ear as punishment; i‘ll never forget.
1428905_a2428929|
1209077_a2251604|i think they're getting less, because education needs to get better.
1582205_a2046539|bmw for instance/
1179224_a3257145|hamburg doesn’t have many green spaces.
2021499_a2686227|you'd wait as long as the fire's burning.
1413485_a2142063|they were really present in the media.
1183917_a2872005|ah okay, so not a lot happened, got it.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2804928|that’s why it’s better for me if i continue going to school.
1414123_a2768026|i participated first for athletics.
1209077_a2250011|the ci and one other implant, i don't know what it's called.
1204891_a2758107|the communication wasn't a problem either.
1290126_a3237513|i don’t like the fact that we still have to pay.
1178133_a2896400|i also saw it on tv and in the newspaper, it was intense.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2900771|ah ok, bughaus.
1178939_a3040765|with a deaf teacher, there’s more understanding and one can identify with them.
1200689_a2169561|i won't forget the time i spent there.
1290581_a2937962|right, i was in italy as well, i had partly organized that.
1210997_a2738048|well, i have/
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2001563|i told the others, “look, there's a deaf teacher!”
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1769671|60 to 80 seniors come to our monthly meetings in bremen.
1181455_a2299573|so after being in the sauna for a while, you swim in the thermal water.
1431896_a2996238|i remember recently driving around with my motorcycle, in 2009.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2471804|exactly, boys and girls ate separately.
1246344_a2465387|
1209006_a2696358|well, deaf people also swarm the place/
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2002236|i didn't want that.
1177436_a3166592|i admire deaf people who make it through university.
1204191_a2787182|some students rebelled, that’s why/
1291164_a2457647|carnival isn’t my hobby.
1419931_a2245740|there are kofos [communication panels], as well.
1413683_a2995089|i was still very young when i first came to germany - i was #x.
1177436_a3166599|you can’t take notes and look at them at the same time.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2804780|once i signed for a long time, basically all day.
1211515_a3126957|so, you’re younger than me.
1431896_a2998198|we used to have the german mark as our currency, didn’t we?
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2208874|it is really hilly, and the landscape has a lightness to it.
1419370_a3858044|recently, the effort to get donations was not successful.
1183846_a2865139|even the one that thomas zander and peter schick starred in.
1428821-16453820-16510849_a3203463|in order for it to work, those markings need to be aligned with each other.
1292458_a3057661|all of germany isn’t that special.
1428805_a3040715|i told him that i had problems with my knee.
1431896_a2984831|but will the child feel comfortable with the cochlear implant or not?
1431490_a3229712|and then the screen slowly turns black.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2819187|i don’t want it to continue this way.
1177860_a3195164|but the building has to be empty, and when the company has left it can be rented out.
1205503_a2852095|their emotions are - if i may say so - broken.
1432043_a3030187|nice.
1249951_a2766844|or is it even further to the west?
1184749_a2769446|or communication doesn't work with someone hearing, for example, and i tell him i don't understand him.
1205503_a2772215|after all, we know that, too. for instance, when a woman and a man flirt with each other.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1785800|ok, not scissors, just ninepins.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767616|i wanted to do something with the possibility to achieve more.
1176566_a1705414|it was very popular at first and the department got more and more members, but now the group gets smaller because bowling is very expensive.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2001640|we thought, well, there's going to be a sports class later, then we can talk to her.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2404500|he's not brave enough to sign.
1206131_a3059888|if it was slippery you just would slip.
1247835_a2632754|i can chose between those two groups.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2885740|i don't know; it would be hard for them.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2819078|i didn’t understand any of the contents, i just went way over my head.
1433543_a3026737|i don’t know.
1250646_a3069786|but they pretended as if they weren’t.
1582205_a2043469|we didn’t have to put on uniforms and say, “be ready!” [“be ready! - always ready!” was a pioneers’ slogan in the gdr.]
1290754_a3172278|but i wasn’t sure.
1200689_a3914599|
1180556_a2618215|thirdly, westerwelle [german politician] is all talk but has no work to show for it.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2002245|i thought, “why not?”
1984213_a3228957|the cat is back again.
1291892_a2030211|many people died.
1180724_a2904945|i don't feel comfortable with that.
1182135_a2749623|have you been to the open day in cologne?
1583950_a3259247|yes.
1205568_a2886969|a couple of colleagues came to my sign language class and i taught them to sign.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1778457|i go there daily.
1176846_a2895693|
1583043_a1847758|no, it was during the youth festival in the gsv [gsv= gehörlosen sport verein; engl.: deaf sports club].
1178939_a2974932|yes, those basics would be taught by deaf people.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1779853|i had that thought, because i made a motorcycle trip through the sauerland region and looked around.
1245390_a2782694|*i talked about it in bulgaria and everyone was really surprised and interested.
1178133_a2897522|i loved gerd müller.
1428038_a2159434|we, the younger ones - the next generation so to speak - know the truth and don't believe it.
1187152_a3074434|the theater is important to me, it’s about sign language.
1290121_a2767595|i'm somewhat a fan of him as a player.
1250721_a3324966|then, i worked somewhere else again.
1181838_a2909565|they had to rescue and take care of the people from the first tower.
1291243_a2381106|trying to clear that up, taking unpaid vacation, that’s too complicated, no.
1428805_a3006018|if you have a bite, it also contains water.
1433410_a2384821|an interpreter asked me because the daughter was going to school there.
1429964_a2205745|and then she got to the school in dortmund and i wasn't sure if everything would work out.
1291572_a2563426|oh, ok, school.
1290126_a3233200|that’s a possibility, but it was never officially stated. the stasi always kept everything under wraps.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2905162|everything is fine among deaf people, it is, however, more difficult to meet and communicate with hearing people.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767737|it was hard, all the trouble about the divorce, selling the house and everything.
1429781-13002707-13070302_a2366715|i’m 10 years older than that, but your wife is the same age as my wife.
1181455_a2323285|there are nice walking paths, too.
1291572_a2563688|they took more laws from germany.
1433543_a3025429|i would definitely recommend that.
1289623_a2563272|when the raw meat was brought, i had to take a deep breath.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805161|well, once/
1584545_a2205150|and old washboards are hanging on the walls.
1289793_a2952350|sure there are.
1427368_a3243026|for example, if someone talks to me very quickly and afterwards makes me sign my name on a form.
1204239_a3078547|yes, right, #she lived in name5. her father/
1582205_a2043489|those times were over.
1205568_a2880444|so she wrote a letter and sent it to director #name1.
1292768_a2386516|“so you can't hear”, they said.
1428472_a3228779|i think about how i taught signs to little kids in the past.
1427810_a3041659|i know that.
1212176_a2754207|communication, yes.
1183917_a2872144|there were a couple of broken bridges in the harbor and a few paths that were still okay.
1248090_a2700269|puberty is all about power.
1248090_a2699633|germany is a neighboring country; that‘s why they have german as a mandatory class.
1180097_a1682186|but then they said, i wouldn't get my driver's license.
1428472_a3227987|it’s no more than a small cut!
1209910_a2860041|the time passes quickly nevertheless.
1177436_a3017483|wow, that’s interesting.
1179224_a3261480|as typical of northern germany, people in hamburg speak hochdeutsch [high german dialects].
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2785860|that way, one automatically smokes less, automatically.
1419265_a2967008|dvd, right.
1292770_a2386829|“da.“
1184536_a2430040|of course, they all got permits.
1212176_a2751601|
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1785903|he then dropped the whole game and left.
1206172_a3077459|but because his son is standing behind him, the father keeps turning around.
1413485_a2132011|if you see diana, you automatically remember everything from the past.
1245462_a2372008|there were rules like with “rock, paper, scissors“ or something similar with some extra things on top.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2878751|people kept staring at me.
1249951_a2761171|spring is great as well, isn't it?
1178754_a3040977|well, of course that is so true.
1419607_a3389438|yes, horrible. but they do not care, they ignore everything, it does not matter to them.
1249302_a2535403|and then it was over.
1204694_a2789514|but scolding, pressuring or attacking them is not allowed.
1211283_a2761377|my dad was an auditor for the city and also for a deaf club in the north.
1413925_a2805200|and i wanted to just wait for the moment.
1177054_a3050874|or is it an undercurrent that pulls one under?
1248862_a2788291|my eyes were red and hurting a lot.
1182801_a1943638|the advantage is that you receive unemployment benefits once the self-employment does not work out.
1292125_a2063553|of course, dust was whirled up.
1248400_a2840053|that's normal.
1182062_a2781201|hotels and apartments one next to the other.
1245356_a2774673|i tell them no, because we tell each other everything.
1418903_a2896862|he was in the school for the deaf there as well.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a1998962|i'm not ok with that.
1582654_a3114793|will there soon be finals?
1249620_a2597451|that would be fine.
1184089_a2760447|that's when i first learned about diana's accident in france.
1289462_a2970844|yes, there’s no other way.
1184145_a2807540|that is wrong, um/
1413925_a2793398|“come here”, was all he said.
1246772_a2387598|they told me i had barely passed.
1212218_a2941423|yet, you would like to go there again someday.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767653|but this is nice.
1184756_a3119430|we chatted in the car as well.
1184089_a2773081|it's kind of similar.
1290754_a3173282|even though our opinions weren’t always easy to establish.
1179389_a3530532|with that money they were able to buy barrels of oil and collect and keep them.
1212611_a2785991|once we got to my room, we signed a lot and quickly. my mother didn’t control us.
1292770_a2393930|someone approached me and said, “oh! you can speak.“
1428225_a2158668|but it was a semi-detached house and we did have neighbors.
1204694_a2789501|he said it would make him happy.
1210206-11564230-11595227_a2779636|he had already been to berlin because/ why was he in berlin again?
1249376_a2843218|nowadays? still? i don’t know.
1245820_a2868159|you can get advice from a lawyer beforehand.
1181011_a2144054|he may have been president for only two or three years.
1210825_a3267587|i’ll get a colleague and tell them that i can’t understand the patient because of their missing teeth.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a2699250|you can fold it over, as well, and put it around your neck and over your head. that‘s nice as well.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1769614|the village was really small.
1250059_a2521156|sure, over the years, i probably would have been increasingly annoyed with some things.
1431222_a2139423|i'm guessing almost everyone knew her.
1210206-11564230-11595227_a2779606|the wife, jacqueline, is that right, jacqueline?
1419607_a3414477|she protests against it, together with interpreters.
1184089_a2772931|the first ones.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787517|it’s the exact opposite of the companies, they need to sell cigarettes and work to make money.
1427725_a2116238|three or four.
1178939_a3041047|it’s important for the development of children to make this clear to them from a young age.
1414312_a2772317|before that, the cultural days were in cologne; those were also very nice.
1177436_a3141967|that’s right.
1290754_a3172287|he was okay at his job, but he didn’t care a lot about deaf people.
1585089_a2475080|no, he’d been on a one week vacation.
1184367_a2568092|the painter is famous, but unfortunately i don't know his name.
1176566_a1706032|there used to be more to do.
1178347_a2897769|well, it was too late for that.
1418836-15524810-15550340_a3218751|i picked a whole bucket full of blackberries.
1291892_a2154245|i read, though, that people from japan are used to earthquakes.
1183203_a3150073|obviously, just picking up spoken wording didn‘t work for him. i had to come up with something else.
1413703_a2323391|it‘s been a while; i think it was in 2001.
1249376_a3906114|back then we went from sievershausen to beverungen.
1430328_a2175208|that's the only specialty that siegen has to offer.
1204877_a2951546|after, i was confronted with the question what kind of job i would want, so i became a confectioner.
1248862_a2781643|in the movie, she explains that she would’ve liked to come, but that it didn’t work out.
1209077_a2249771|right.
1179389_a3530541|they lack order.
1246566_a3057355|so one just stands there stupidly, waiting until the group has finished talking.
1250279_a2937185|my children don’t live close by, and they’re very busy.
1427368_a3242649|but because it does not exist here, i’d go to america.
1249951_a2766072|if i had been with another person, we at least would have been able to take turns.
1177640_a3080918|the third one has a kind of game with him.
1430590_a2256686|everything had burned down.
1212218_a2456453|i see, mosque.
1210997_a2737890|true. you're right.
1432043_a3031045|nice.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1765005|i was constantly fighting with my parents.
2021499_a2600432|when they opened the door again, everything was full of dust.
1247525_a2558422|if you say you do something then you have to do it and not just talk about it. if you only talk and don't do anything for it/
1183703_a2760871|they felt mildly hurt and felt sorry for them.
1248862_a2782845|sometimes we go on trips or walks across the mudflats.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2907387|it would be pretty easy to set a goal.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2397095|that's more important.
1431222_a2136315|
1204239_a2623330|#it was name5.
1429781-13002707-13070302_a2366542|they were together a long time, ten to twelve years.
1246681_a3257208|because the weather is usually quite good, summers are often very warm.
1183917_a2871676|it’s true, with all of that destruction, i was wondering why they hadn’t started to repair everything right away.
1246772_a2388695|250 euro, phew!
1204694_a2789445|what else?
1418858_a2947115|you don’t have/
1211752_a2750310|a week would be great.
1585089_a3202643|the flight/
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3028608|tailor.
1180097_a1707824|i tried to shift gears but it didn't work. oh, yes, i forgot to turn on the engine. then i started driving.
1211515_a3247463|it amazed me because i had never thought about it before. yet, it didn’t really matter.
1248625-15324720-15465943_a2782171|it’s been around for a long time.
1245390_a2782367|on the topic of, for example/
1177002_a3252824|but if he were slapped on the ears, it would be painful and he would have to undergo further treatment.
1205503_a2772405|you are even allowed to love five men.
1429781-13002707-13070302_a2366426|450 are gone.
1428475-13374607-13392508_a3229102|nowadays, it’s forbidden. but there used to be fancy houses.
1248862_a2783734|it happened to me again and again.
1210156-17573900-18041027_a3231090|so i told him a lot of interesting things.
1204239_a3070965|but my sister is rarely among deaf people.
1427725_a3033869|she is spelled with an “h”.
1182062_a2774497|only the bakery was already open.
1582399-11073030-11154047_a2735002|well.
1428038_a2159268|the moon pictures show a curvature that is much too strong.
1247205_a2239867|he was paying, not you.
1204239_a3069630|she always says, “all deaf people are fake and bad.” but by saying so she’s fake and bad, too.
1179856_a3042297|you start.
1184367_a3917630|for instance, you get to know that there's a special play about a special topic at the theatre.
1181838_a2773888|the first one?
1427725_a2113222|i think you can’t always find common ground.
1250646_a3022281|i need to ask you, maybe you remember: was there a warranty on the trabant in the gdr?
1419265_a2971909|in the end, she can’t cope with it, puts an end to it and goes back home.
1582205_a2566139|that depends.
1179224_a3275540|i find it quite interesting that hamburg also has some poor areas.
1244978_a2430582|
1210156-17573900-18041027_a3231179|i really enjoyed that.
1290126_a3240972|same thing for the east and west.
1249280-16043122-16070610_a3186480|in the store, i have to search for a bit.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1768467|every meeting has its own topic and different speakers.
1419797_a2743788|when i meet deaf people, i sign fast and then i feel comfortable.
1249620_a2651585|some got the ci when they were still young.
1178347_a2897757|later, the queen had to acknowledge that everyone loved diana and that she was even more famous than her.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2783833|that was confusing, suddenly being surrounded by hearing people.
1180097_a1683932|i was waiting outside until my driving teacher came and went about.
1291243_a2380892|and she gets extra vacation.
1248625-15324720-15465943_a2776758|but i didn’t go sightseeing a lot.
1180097_a1720808|the drivers license examiner put his hand on the my driving teacher's shoulder and shook his head.
1246100_a2746243|wow, so many in one place.
1184145_a2797941|well, um.
1584545_a2202981|if you go a little further past lake cospunden, you can take round boat trips and they have a small harbor there.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a3129080|the school is located on tonstraße [street name], isn‘t it?
1432043_a3030290|the christmas market, it’s called christ market there, is also really great.
1413703_a2315196|yes, more and more hard of hearing people participate because of the money, and the deaf people are the ones losing out.
1204877_a2926319|i mostly spoke with my parents.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2804785|it was just as though my thoughts were slower than my signs.
1583882_a1975965|do you have 16,000?
1289793_a2939270|it’s some sort of exhibition.
1433410_a2383196|hmm.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2907385|the contacts, the clubs, the deaf club, the subway, and so on — everything.
1210156-17573900-18041027_a3231208|it was really nice.
1187218_a3191711|actually, there’s everything.
1210208_a2796618|i think the most important part is that we can be proud to have a german pope and that we can show that pride.
1178364_a2888254|it's too bad.
1585453_a1936675|so the sign mob was on friday.
1419607_a3399139|i also cannot imagine that health insurances will pay everything in the long run, no, i just do not belief that.
1249951_a2766671|ah, i don't know it.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2179831|
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3270146|on the bus, there were pretty curtains on the windows.
1419931_a2262665|well, i drove to falkensee and went to a youth hostel where i made myself at home and talked to people.
1246772_a2388677|it is for sign language teachers.
1585089_a3102002|then we’ll know.
1433655_a2207937|we went there together.
1427725_a2118192|though i loved how the people acted.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3280126|i couldn’t possibly stay there for two weeks. i was angry/
1291164_a3115041|the next day you need to go back to work and that is always hard for me.
1413683_a2878635|i feel much better living here in germany.
1177702_a2871419|i considered removing the supply closet to have a bigger and more open kitchen space.
1428905_a2428982|i'm lucky: it didn't happen to my family. still, i empathize with the victims.
1210763_a2737705|it was really nice to travel like that.
1176340_a2129791|it is important to me that there is a deaf person with whom i can communicate.
1247525_a2531407|i stopped playing soccer later on.
1184756_a3124819|right.
1178939_a3035594|yes!
1176566_a1706176|it was great back in our days.
1413703_a2325844|i switched off the computer, and when she returned back home later that night, i immediately asked her if she wanted to travel to dubai with me, because it was so incredibly cheap.
1582205_a2040350|it was viewed negatively, although it's not true.
1248862_a2783168|that’s an example.
1414503_a3302874|no, i have never.
1212611_a2781726|“hey, are you alright?“
1583964_a2122811|still, people know about it and go there en masse.
1248625-15324720-15465943_a2782125|there used to be a little factory that produced asparagus.
1200689_a2169596|she accepted it, but she wasn't happy.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3285805|yet, it was very hard and that hurt.
1177292_a2198983|obviously, the sign language festival aimed at presenting sign language.
1431676_a3250612|well, no i‘m really intrigued and want to know a bit more.
1430590_a2261954|but i'm only human.
1428905_a2768865|it affected everyone, and many people were concerned.
1209077_a2249770|they don't want that.
1179389_a3530815|and to have a good overview of the limits.
1419370_a3334377|if he studied 8000 kilometres [4970 miles] away, how would you keep in contact?
1210825_a3189569|the first person to ask me a question was the job centre employee.
1212402_a2732417|i was eager to go to school.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2815210|but the teachers in essen know how to sign?
1246681_a3914344|the chancellor/
1205821_a2537551|ah, in the west!
1220195_a2039806|works for me.
1428472_a3227996|20,000, exactly.
1414503_a2771604|i had an accident with my very first car, someone ignored my right of way.
1249620_a2689327|you just have to tell them you don’t want it.
1248862_a2781019|the organizers were left stranded.
1179224_a3274079|right, that’s interesting.
1178939_a2990589|that’s normal.
1427368_a3243449|i’m quite content with the interpreters.
1248090_a2699795|that‘s it. anything else?
1248862_a2789085|they talked it over and all three traveled there.
1584617_a2660044|
1582654_a2659450|i‘d like to go to the deaflympics, as well, but we‘ll see.
1184756_a3095135|they organized it themselves? that’s awesome.
1585089_a3097205|in the beginning, the beginning?
1433543_a2983162|then there’re the alps and the zugspitze.
1183846_a2865170|i saw that one! that's the play i am very glad to have seen; it was great!
1177918_a2893798|that'll change in the future.
1204877_a2951566|i took the job and stayed with siemens for four years.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2001661|chatting with her worked fine?
1431896_a3002879|it‘s possible to sign with an interpreter.
1182801_a1941188|he was an expert on taxes, and he calculated how much money the people would receive.
2025500_a3273034|oh, that‘s why.
1246772_a2388528|we signed with one another and he knew about me as well.
1245820_a2862834|we both surely follow what is written in the sgb ix.
1420216_a2760976|it doesn't matter if you stand up close or far away, the important thing is that you can see well.
1246102_a2818197|we greet each other like friends, but that's it.
1181240-15572825-16003603_a3191830|i can’t forget that.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2783784|then you talk about new things.
1430832_a2450309|
1431676_a3248503|you can, of course, visit our online presence sometime.
1178939_a3038368|and imagine that being the case in other places in germany, too.
1181602_a3086435|i was only confronted with oral education for a short time at my first school in heilbronn.
1246329_a2762000|were these ss men or what?
1177436_a3133823|one interpreter is good, the other not so much.
1180724_a2678842|but my mother thought that it wasn't going to be a problem. “it'll be alright, it'll be alright,” she said.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2180163|you only get it around here.
1206010_a2497076|it's a draw!
1212416_a2480325|unfortunately.
1584855_a1991924|somebody said that the government handed out coupons so that we could exchange money.
1245462_a2271015|it is nicer if all sign languages differ from each other.
1429964_a2204074|she ended up in the hospital after all and died there.
1419124_a3095311|so the cat gets a banana and tries to trick the monkey into going around the corner.
1251334_a3174444|and then leipzig.
1413451-11105600-11163240_a2856739|we had a great friendship: we could casually hang out and talk to each other.
1585453_a1936493|one including a buffet and reserved seats inside the hall.
1584545_a2243230|i could tell you something about the places that i've visited a couple times.
1177860_a3194337|the workshop will continue to run with ten people until october.
1428225_a2157889|that is why i just don't know whether it's right what you say.
1248625-15324720-15465943_a2780659|yes, it used to be eintracht braunschweig [soccer club of brunswick].
1250646_a3022216|most things were cheap in the gdr.
1582654_a3108187|you pay two dollars.
1418858_a2949216|everyone was watching them.
1432043_a3039100|on the other side, right by the council houses, you can get the famous pharisäer kaffee [literally: pharisee coffee, similar to irish coffee].
1209077_a2251351|well, something new comes up, and then they change it again and again - that’s annoying.
1182062_a2771555|we could talk about our pregnancies, for instance.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2819738|“maybe it’d be better with a piece of equipment that you wear on your chest, with two earbuds.“
1204694_a2789694|i like smart, modest and content people. how about you?
1181159_a3218736|seriously.
1430592_a2266990|i was supposed to stay there, because adults worked there as well.
1414123_a2767800|that's just how it was in berlin.
1244796_a3077494|yes, because we’re used to it.
1181159_a3225120|even though you were eighteen already, of age.
1184536_a2430188|it would save expenses, too.
1428907-11590941-12015445_a2773329|
1427368_a3243347|you were lucky you didn’t need interpreters.
1204691_a2787275|in the west we had the democracy and were free.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2001392|i was six years old.
1205821_a2504768|my uncle was prepared; he had already given all furniture and many pretty things to his relatives.
1246100_a2781099|so my sister and i did some activities together, just the two of us and nobody else.
1247641_a2715278|they have to pay this redress.
1250059_a2481532|yes, they were everywhere, and many of them were informers for the stasi.
1210825_a3189238|i told her that i desperately wanted to become a masseur and a ”medizinischer bademeister” [official german name of a profession that is in some ways similar to a hydrotherapist].
1584545_a2196481|there used to be no elevator/
1292458_a3028684|especially in the country, there is absolutely no work there.
1431676_a3247549|out of all the deaf people in berlin i was the only one.
1177002_a3253087|the family as well/
1289793_a2957610|and soccer of course.
1428805_a3040887|it really hurt but i pulled myself together.
1419607_a3414603|i went to my school’s 200 year anniversary.
1583950_a3250234|we were five deaf people and two hard of hearing people, yes, i think that was it, five and two.
1220195_a2054689|my brother didn't know that the child was hearing.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2804817|my life has changed but i still use sign language every single day.
1413703_a3522590|the price doesn‘t matter as long as the apartment is clean.
1419370_a3321326|berlin would make more sense because it is central and has good connections to other places.
1427810_a2456762|yes, it doesn’t matter.
1419931_a2274826|some germans say they find people from berlin very annoying and unpleasant.
1181397_a2252709|later on - after the fall of the berlin wall - i went back there to look at everything.
1247835_a2605174|
1583882_a2885814|especially for me as a deaf person, for instance if there was a text flat or something like that for free.
1183703_a2760778|he should have retreated.
1245820_a2862755|the problem is, the problem with that is/
1290754_a3172286|a year or two later it started that a lot of people spoke about him.
2025500_a3277356|that‘s why the hotels are completely booked.
1249741_a2794538|this way, you can witness how it feels like and how loud these things are.
1248699_a2752765|what happened in japan got the politicians thinking.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2000215|my mom was heavily pregnant then.
1583950_a3833182|somewhere in that area there was a kindergarten, and i went there amongst many hearing children.
1183846_a2865083|nowadays there are more and more posters that address the topic of art.
1291243_a2379289|no, victims.
1976261_a2212615|stop, i can’t listen to that.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787944|the cancer had spread, he had metastases.
1584411_a2071183|later on, our son was born who is also deaf.
1184367_a2581119|respect!
1179224_a3257194|one of these chefs is top-class; he has already received 19 points!
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2469538|it's the bass.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a2010872|as if no one is supposed to know anything about the hartz iv people and everyone thinks the government is great.
1428907-11590941-12015445_a2903388|you are right.
1289462_a2397499|it would be really bad for me to lose my hands.
1250059_a2481523|yet, the students didn't know anything about it.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a2471085|we told the school management what we wanted from them.
1200689_a2169590|when he came back, he brought back new signs which spread rapidly all over the school.
1419607_a3395884|it is way too early for such a big change.
1247849_a2791427|suddenly, there was the tagesschau [german news program] on tv.
1414312_a2771835|two years before the deaflympics in melbourne, during the european championships in england, we were already prepared and alert.
1247525_a2531382|i was in a soccer club with hearing people since i was little.
1183203_a3127076|but the hearing aid does.
1431896_a2999779|okay.
1582205_a2040173|right. shall i go on?
1430590_a2256817|around ‘46 i moved from the village back to cologne.
1210763_a2739753|do you go out, do you meet up with friends, do you play soccer?
1184089_a2760693|i will never forget that.
1181397_a2249654|it all was so exciting.
1244742_a2479407|we had a soccer tournament.
1247205_a2239301|right, that is new:
1428225_a2157891|but sometimes you just need music with a little bass.
1212176_a2752186|the second one was to israel and then to cyprus.
1210763_a2738044|
1247641_a2723148|is that true? i didn't know that.
1247205_a2212299|i apologized and said that i didn't mean to do that, and that i had looked for them everywhere to finally find them.
1583043_a1856136|it was a nice evening. kind of like a gala night, with a cultural programme.
1291636_a3090291|i didn’t like going inside that either.
1250972_a2962855|my frame was pretty cheap.
1250279_a2998872|i’ll have to write a fax to the interpreter who can then call 9-1-1.
1429310_a2261461|
1582654_a3109595|it was freezing.
1182062_a2774435|every once in a while i drank a coffee.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787246|i didn’t vote in the elections.
1585453_a2903695|weren't you at the türkisparade yourself?
1178347_a2962986|
1210206-11564230-11595227_a2779641|yes, that’s it.
1413703_a2325856|you should have taken it right away.
1419128_a3096198|then the cat leaves and comes back with a wooden board.
1246772_a2387000|what happened?
1182062_a2781245|they bring in people from india for example.
1419265_a2972104|poor guy.
1212218_a2456529|i’m so tired of the constant fighting.
1250721_a3284327|i always had to recite something.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2882014|you just have to try to slowly sign easy words. that way, it’s possible to understand each other.
1180097_a1684044|he wanted to test me.
1249951_a2761185|it's pleasing.
1584545_a2284959|yes.
1290126_a3222727|one has to be patient.
1179224_a3272074|it was just a hole in the ground with a lid made of concrete.
1210763_a2740416|or going on a balloon trip.
1289793_a2932669|the musical styles are separated through the different rooms.
1245595_a3080005|the bus reaches its destination without any problems.
1176407_a2884929|it's a very memorable place.
1182801_a1941802|you can earn some money with this one-euro job additionally to the unemployment benefits.
1413251_a3028426|the languages are there, now they need to start doing something!
1249302_a2535432|i need my sleep.
1200689_a2169549|and people answer, “i know.“
1206172_a3080389|of course, the tea overspills.
1419265_a2972135|but he let it be.
1250279_a2941970|it was the first time for me. i just didn’t know what to say.
1177436_a3017627|but i don’t know why the wall was built.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2808949|that’s why more hearing teachers are employed.
1290754_a3172260|he was the first, then came hoffmann with ulrich neumann, and they led the club together.
1212176_a2779032|only with deaf people, with whom i signed.
1419607_a3414981|when i asked him, he confirmed it and said he was more than 74 years of age, yes.
1428805_a3042248|my memory/
1176846_a2882318|i want to have a barbecue for my birthday. there would be something to drink and we could be outside on the patio.
1413451-11105600-11163240_a2934251|it's exhausting.
1183917_a2871603|those images were taken by people who were standing closeby and luckily not taken by the water.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3275118|the other accommodation was intolerable.
1209077_a2249755|more and more people of these failures are 'thrown in'.
1433543_a2983245|right, that’s great.
1291638_a3108865|there was no industry.
1431428_a3040484|i could feel the music and even got goosebumps.
1429910-16075041-16115817_a3075817|i got my ticket back.
1184756_a3133627|i am going to travel to denmark.
1178147_a2722887|previously the theater in dortmund was quite good, but after a couple of productions it became quiet around it.
1246772_a2837090|you have to handle it.
1292458_a3025862|what’s typical for hearing people, for example, is a disco.
1248862_a2783934|one day, around midday, i sat together with some deaf people and chatted.
1290754_a3171477|but i changed that slowly.
1178939_a2974938|you didn’t make it?
1212176_a2751960|many people became shoemakers and carpenters after finishing school.
1430396_a3267656|i didn’t go to a boarding school, i mean, kindergarten. i didn’t go to kindergarten.
1433543_a3291981|from a couple of spots, one can also walk up to the peaks.
1211752_a2752690|with very sharp teeth.
1211515_a3240034|the food was better than the stuff we got at school.
1177002_a3259536|i wouldn’t be willing to do that.
1181159_a3147364|yes, two times a week.
1291243_a2382028|i thought the tiles would be square. but i was wrong, they were big and rectangular.
1180254_a2172571|my mother was different in this aspect.
1177860_a3148248|i’ll rather put money into an envelope.
1184749_a2782618|we looked at each other and i thought she was hearing.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2281354|my wage would be the same in the end.
1211531_a2058840|we had to open the trunk so it could be checked again.
1209006_a2563934|we drink beer and celebrate together.
1200689_a2169558|at the hauptschule, all the students were deaf. one was allowed to sign, and i felt comfortable.
1205821_a2537540|they were very very expensive.
1420216_a2742643|so, you have never been there?
1585089_a2474952|oh, stop it.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3260706|there were both deaf youths and elderly people.
1180022_a3077111|the next day, the boy gets up and realizes that the frog is gone.
1585089_a3107124|that’s unbelievable.
1584617_a3261288|
1248862_a2784151|it was weird, that was the first time i had heard that word.
1248505_a2756328|charles might not even be his father but hewitt supposedly is.
1430592_a2267174|but i was good at lip reading and still used my voice.
1184367_a2570066|people cannot live without culture.
1292125_a2065322|if the lunar module had landed in the front area, you could have watched it with a special telescope.
1181602_a3086388|nothing was oral, so that was great, and we were signing at school as well.
1183203_a3181602|#name2.
1585453_a1936543|i think it's from the 20th to the 22nd.
1290581_a2937973|right, i remember, you were there as well.
1180724_a2679715|they believe that it will only sign and neglect the hearing.
1205503_a2769869|they rape children and in the worst cases, they even kill the children.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2814362|the teachers thought it was important, however.
1250966_a2544925|then the berlin wall fell.
1290581_a2955051|i automatically waved at and greeted the people, that was a great feeling.
1431222_a2129860|since i've been to all the others before, i have to go to the one in erfurt otherwise that one would be missing in my collection.
1177860_a3202918|insolation just isn’t right with vertical walls.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805005|yes.
1180097_a1707885|when everything was set and ready, i started the car and started driving.
1427810_a3039141|one of those 250 gram packages to pour.
1583322-12534537-13002913_a2524946|my son knows his way around computers but my daughter-in-law not so much.
1430396_a3268043|everyone keeps to themself and keeps others at a distance.
1429781-13002707-13070302_a2367533|if one does it like that, everything works out while chatting.
1179224_a3274110|my friend explained to me why sheep are valuable.
1292086_a2558089|i attended a vocational school, however not one for the deaf but rather one for hearing people.
1179389_a3530807|they have just lost control and do not even notice it anymore.
1177002_a3259731|it really is a difficult question.
1433410_a2904769|yes, that's true.
1184367_a2560951|back then, photography wasn't digital, yet.
1583043_a1856149|i must say, that was a bold decision.
1427810_a3057178|the van is great, i drive/
1431676_a3247523|they always immediately wanted to contact the national association for the smallest things.
1247849_a2819256|his sister’s daughter is called shriver/
1210763_a2728807|i've already been seven times and it never gets old.
1248699_a2755146|so the radioactive waste rattles around.
1414312_a2772097|how the german soccer team won the fifa championship in bern against the hungarian soccer team, even though they lost in the preliminary matches against them.
1292545_a2517548|it's good to know people with whom you get along well, and who like and support you.
1290126_a3238672|you could protest.
1430590_a2256893|all of a sudden my teacher took me there, because i arranged the letters that fast.
1210208_a2795310|while i was watching it, i thought, “dammit!“.
1212176_a2779465|sometimes i struggle with the german language, but other than that, i am pleased.
1428472_a3220104|i left school in 1956.
1291243_a2382045|i built that myself, but i didn’t tell anyone.
1418858_a2932654|… we drive there and we will need the last day for the drive home.
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3112651|we suggested the new idea to communicate via chats.
1250059_a2518453|but back in the gdr things were different - it was crueler.
1419370_a3335311|wait, but it’s true that you didn’t have any children with your ex-wife when you two split up.
1205168_a2750051|though looking back, i, too, think it is interesting.
1184756_a3134038|it’s not a big deal. i’ve already asked him, he will be able to pick me up.
1427368_a3242905|in duisburg for example, they built this special mosque there.
1428472_a3228748|my father, oh well.
1431224_a2150141|we felt a companionship between us all.
1244796_a3079249|they dislike it and keep on using germany-asl.
1204891_a2760527|the two of us decided we wanted to get in contact with josef rothkopf.
1177054_a3050621|surely, there are different ones.
1419607_a3394844|when my son was a little bit older, i asked him if he would like to have a ci.
1431982_a3078392|in the meantime, more and more animals have come to the son: deers, wild boars and other cute animals.
1246772_a3721948|good!
1584545_a2196486|did you already climb them?
1419931_a2256978|that's nice.
1205951_a3114060|for example, i first think about what i can expect of the event i’ve been invited to.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3289379|other deaf persons who wanted to book the flight had to wait.
1419931_a2262578|yes, beelitz.
1204891_a2759062|then they had a funeral and, how can i put this, a memo/
1290126_a3230321|to hungary, or from the gdr to poland.
1177702_a2872021|yes, i've noticed that too, you're right.
1209309-13425110-13472919_a2792479|that too, yes.
1582399-11073030-11154047_a2728359|we were three deaf children.
1182517_a2335846|in the evenings for example we used to have a good time at boarding school.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3158054|it was folded over around the neck.
1248090_a2699607|but, whatever.
1180097_a1707978|he also really pushed me to strive.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2208940|a peculiarity relates to the thirty years' war.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3262848|the flight took more than twelve hours. it was hard to bear.
1290121_a2748961|there was this one soccer match: germany against the german democratic republic.
1585453_a1934834|the starting point, i don't remember exactly, i think it was at the trade fair/
1184089_a2760772|one could say she was a likable woman.
1179864_a3034989|a driving instructor wouldn’t tell you that it doesn’t matter which way the sign is turned.
1583882_a1975046|1999.
1181159_a3217167|so, you‘re asking why i chose to commute?
1181397_a2249063|he always said that he wished for it to happen.
1183703_a2759240|i wondered about the fronts since they were enemies.
1427725_a2098423|it was something special.
1419610-11552205-12003930_a3402039|that’s what he taught us. he also had us do gymnastics as a breathing exercise. we had to tighten all our muscles.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2000232|she was so worried.
1182062_a2772515|one or two things are missing.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2899957|i didn't see him before, because i had concentrated on the sawing.
1428805_a3005804|but they are tasty.
1211752_a2750760|so if there’s the opportunity, i have to try it, no matter if it’s dangerous or not, don’t i?!
1211515_a3248605|and, hold on, and/
1179868_a2546661|you should buy one soon, they are on sale at the moment.
1584855_a1998328|the nursery school educators knew that a lot of people went to the west germany to do some shopping and that they all would come back the next day.
1585089_a2475057|there used to also be alfa romeo.
1245390_a2782760|they wanted the workshop to be more orally oriented.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2813873|us girls all went downstairs to watch tv.
1291638_a3102007|i used to only live four train stops from school.
1183720-17021701-17054739_a2755062|it had a roof, but the smoke kept rising to the top and into our faces.
2025500_a3277382|that was in 2001.
1431488_a3229126|the cat is catapulted into the air.
1583214_a1856821|it's true, you can see it in the case of the polar bears.
1212176_a2751994|in only nine or ten years there has been such a step forward?
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2898214|many of the hearing pulled the handle for sawing carelessly because they were in a rush, so the saw blade was ripped over and over again.
1179868_a2546638|it's so badly blocked that the water really builds up and people start panicking.
1246772_a2388540|for them, what’s more important is the grammar, linguistics and so on.
1200691_a2171547|it wouldn't work without facial expressions.
1176340_a2358017|no, not about family.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767636|my daughter doesn't have her baby yet.
1180724_a2663183|then the communication doesn't work for a couple of days.
1582399-11073030-11154047_a2725699|you talked for a long time. that's nice.
1419931_a2315598|no, by my choice of words.
1205503_a2769859|they can't take it any longer, therefore they commit suicide.
1179212_a2880829|it’s just sad that his life was so short, it was just too short.
1183846_a2864818|when i got a little older, my mother heard about paris.
1414503_a2773994|then my neighbor asked somebody sitting next to us, saying that it was taking quite some time.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2884255|see, diversity is interesting.
1419607_a3389409|but here in berlin it is not really working out with school.
1210825_a3201387|at school, we would have a new schedule every six months.
1431676_a3248773|we are all the same.
1184367_a2570961|but people get unhappy through restrictions.
1419370_a3290840|for complete nonsense, nothing should be payed.
1433655_a2208069|if i see another deaf person on the streets we just go past each other.
1184145_a2810129|that is enough for me.
1204191_a2786684|ah, i didn‘t know that.
1289462_a2395632|even if i had an interpreter with me, it would still be exhausting.
1184145_a2810248|i will try.
1177436_a3140105|i’m the one affected.
1419265_a2972150|the man talks to the children.
1205503_a2769885|it sort of develops.
1431676_a3250583|that‘s quite something.
1290754_a3172189|it’s annoying to drive, true, but most of them come to the board meetings.
1414563_a3074185|once a week i was allowed to borrow books from the library, but that quickly became quite boring because it was written language.
1427368_a3231952|in east germany there were very old buildings and west germany had to pay for them to get rebuilt.
1584198_a2659999|yes, i know wkw.
1184089_a2773043|when it happened there was also a sea of flowers.
1211752_a2745764|but at the same time, it’s my last option; if i don’t find anything else, i’ll go there.
1244978_a2443196|there were around 400 deaf students attending our school at a rough guess.
1429310_a2256397|once you have fun and are successful, one simply keeps going.
1431896_a3011739|i am with you.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1768478|because of their spread living situation, i have to pick everyone up.
1427810_a3057024|it’s practical for taking over.
1433410_a2382463|i also had no contact to hearing people.
1420216_a2775188|some of my friends' basements were soiled and destroyed, but no one’s house collapsed.
1419265_a2972054|something else.
1177436_a3140084|a simple example/
1427725_a2099350|i know a funny story about that.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2002176|it was like that in gdr times.
1183203_a3151047|i was stunned and asked myself if that is actually true.
1428038_a2163895|her partner was sitting next to her; he was immediately dead.
1585089_a3121823|i’d always wanted to photograph that.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2944977|sure. it must be hard to hear that as a referee.
1427810_a3048564|who is on your team?
1419265_a2972167|one should be very sure beforehand and have talked about it with their partner already.
1418889_a2704520|as i was used to the happy-go-lucky lifestyle at my granny’s, i really had to adjust to a very new situation.
1205568_a2812742|my mother asked me, “#name4, did you go there?“
1583964_a2022401|i had to think about it first.
1584617_a3261062|
1413703_a2323330|yes, to tunisia.
1419797_a2742402|i was feeling really comfortable there, because i could sign with them.
1181027_a2166011|there were too many.
1584545_a2203085|we are planning on going there for the second time very soon.
1210997_a2726624|it took us a year to prepare for the anniversary celebration.
1585453_a1936485|after that, the crowd broke up.
1429781-13002707-13070302_a2366138|now, everything is so expensive.
1432043_a2962392|it’s this small.
1180546_a3009690|if a child is sitting in the back of the bicycle, it needs to wear a helmet.
1433543_a3023936|i forgot.
1181159_a3223918|at the bbw everybody is so grown up. that‘s confusing at first, and it takes a while to get used and adapt to it.
1178364_a2885304|are they showing the play in march?
1419265_a2972018|yes, all covered up like that.
1428907-11590941-12015445_a2432508|yet, the main point was to see that it had been a great time.
1413703_a3856257|i mean, they shouldn‘t concentrate too much on playing technically correct but rather on being flexible with the ball and on including various players.
1418858_a2947122|i’m wondering who won.
1204877_a2954480|other than that, there’s not much.
1244796_a3082441|they opposed the sign german because they didn’t like it.
1210156-17573900-18041027_a3231128|and ulrich hase and jürgen stachlewitz, all of them at once!
1292125_a2071261|all of a sudden you could see two feet jumping down.
1245462_a2382104|all sign languages in europe should remain.
1585089_a3121718|there used to also be audi and mercedes, always.
1246102_a2817750|back when lithuania was still part of russia, people were only allowed to use russian sign language.
1429310_a2261453|meaning our team won that year and the others were out of luck.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a1996598|i had to laugh and couldn't believe it when i caught this from a guy i know.
1177918_a2881344|
1177860_a3021184|you can’t ever be a 100 per cent secure.
1583950_a3259288|in our club, we really stuck together, and it was really noteworthy that we always had very nice conversations.
1418889_a2744328|okay, then mechanics.
1179212_a2880801|no, puttrich.
1179224_a3257073|i’d like to discover new insider tips, places to go to, swimming for instance.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2820372|i didn’t understand anything.
1181011_a2144298|it was given by martin luther king.
1582439_a2020902|the queen visited the children, too.
1204877_a2954421|no, he died during the war, he died in the war.
1250972_a2524384|we have to talk for 15 minutes straight?
1184536_a2432675|so even more people would have to be hired.
1210825_a3201341|i needed the space for my study books, the text telephone and all the other stuff.
1210206-12000807-12040142_a2795102|if my husband is watching soccer, i’m there for a few minutes and then leave again.
1212218_a2934175|they were already able to calculate it back then.
1431676_a3247555|never heard of it.
1428472_a3218966|i’m happy they’re all different.
1183035_a2773554|at least i think that's how it went.
1433655_a2207941|it was a nice group of deaf people.
1413251_a3186117|i can’t imagine anyone being able to change that. that’s deeply ingrained in us.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a2699222|now wait a second. the rectangle needed a slit in the middle of each side.
1249376_a2841919|that’s where i got it from.
1428225_a2156972|sometimes they took part in those gatherings.
1428472_a3228039|suddenly it was so loud, i had to cover my ears.
1245356_a2785620|right.
1289462_a2969325|i thought i did, but i don’t notice it.
1205568_a2810614|so i went somewhere else.
1292770_a2393960|the teachers were good and tried hard.
1181455_a2302480|i recently went to the christmas market and walked around there.
1177436_a3017593|nice!
1176566_a1706085|he held four offices.
1249741_a2774040|there are certain exhibitions at a small museum.
1209077_a2249942|if i, as a deaf parent, have a deaf child, i am supposed to give him/her the opportunity to get implanted.
1212402_a2772143|he, too, asked me if i really wanted to take the exam.
1178939_a3035549|but they’re together with the hard of hearing students.
1245820_a2857419|there's still trouble with the integration office concerning work life.
1244796_a3082672|there are also the signs mum and father, this mother and this father, but let‘s leave this aside.
1583882_a1975815|everyone has to accept that.
1247205_a2238961|yes, right.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2001954|it was more about sentences there.
1181455_a2324399|by regional rail.
1247525_a2529120|i really enjoy that.
1290581_a2954456|austerity measures and the amount of time are relatively short to manage everything in two years.
1430592_a2899333|in the beginning i was sad when my mother died, because i was deaf and insecure.
1184756_a3095154|what a nice idea.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2195627|if they were staying longer, i would recommend bremerhaven, as well.
1247835_a2632625|yes.
1413451-11105600-11163240_a2836441|something else that was remarkable/
1178939_a3023090|that’d be included, right.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2002131|no, that was later.
1184536_a2934224|i saw something in a museum of refugees in bremerhaven.
1419931_a2273686|they are good at repartee.
1246566_a3056227|and it doesn’t matter if they spend two or three years together at school.
1418858_a2944123|right, that’s because it starts to be too much at once.
1177702_a2868062|and don't forget about the basement and/
1209077_a2251647|a little girl with glasses, did you watch that?
1210825_a3189650|i told them i’d be back and that we’d all see one another again.
1249620_a2643292|whoever has a ci should learn sign language, too.
1177860_a3191038|let’s see how it will develop.
1247205_a2240236|
1431896_a2998215|that is very intense.
1419607_a3398936|of course, there are also elderly people who hear less and less over time; and neither sign language nor a ci are an option for them.
1250279_a2941948|you can call when you have problems with a letter, for example, and then get an answer.
1210763_a2740426|right.
1248400_a2756229|sometimes people get arrested.
1248941-12280641-12344740_a2929108|i watch more closely then.
1187152_a3074397|yes, alright, that’s a good idea.
1414123_a2768083|i mean, i'm a bit older now anyway.
1205821_a2492219|then the wall was closed.
1585089_a3198623|we talked, exchanged thoughts and i got autographs.
1249965-15581230-16013736_a3136038|onto the second step.
1245390_a2782664|someone tapped us on the shoulder there - they probably had already seen us sign - and asked us, signing, whether we had a lighter.
1289793_a2939338|it’s like that for quite a while, behind there there’s bielefeld.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767764|i'm still in contact with many of them.
1248862_a2784211|my parents thanked him and said goodbye.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805209|we were talking and the educator was also involved.
1183203_a3160765|later on, you can take the time to look at books with your child and explain them.
1244581_a2516113|hm, well.
1177860_a3176920|but he didn’t expect windows to be that expensive.
1418858_a2932560|because of the feeling of deaf power and the over all confidence, right?
1180092_a3014921|
1184145_a2790129|not the biggest but one of the biggest.
1204691_a2850343|young people will have to worry in the future.
1212218_a2964869|what does it cost?
1250721_a3360797|yes, maybe you could shovel snow in winter.
1212176_a2778988|a teacher recommended heidelberg to me.
1250059_a2481549|yes, right. there were two possible ways.
1584411_a2043778|it was a really hard time during the german democratic republic.
1177436_a3167218|if someone dares to reply.
1248699_a2752789|they debated how to deal with nuclear power in germany in the future.
1292768_a2386706|yes, that's natural.
1583214_a1859917|but it was too late for that.
1184536_a3004343|far more germans than english people emigrated there.
1290754_a3172119|that’s impossible.
1291572_a2605084|though, i visit the lutheran service in the deaf club in my leisure time and there i give my donations.
1204694_a2789431|just one.
1245462_a2262943|i sometimes like the other signs because they are different and it would be a very dull world, if all sign languages were the same.
1178364_a2887222|now the child is grown up and i am relieved.
1431676_a3250538|yes. yes, we are in touch with the center.
1419607_a3409903|yes, on that topic, but/
1419607_a3403089|there, yes.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2285698|i went to spain, france or london during the time that i graduated.
1180724_a2679703|the parents/
1585089_a3108778|it said that the little boy has cancer/
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2178644|skating? sure.
1430832_a2449829|everyone was equal.
1427725_a2099094|heels that made your walk more elegant became fashionable.
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3013544|there are differences.
1180546_a3009694|and when you skate, you should also wear one.
1177436_a3017607|oh, right.
1177918_a2881386|but if they are really going to make it in 2010?
1249741_a2785058|mcdonald's of course.
1247205_a2240215|it might be better to get your insurance in addition for 170 euros.
1247641_a2794378|it was allowed for another year. then it was banned.
1204191_a2784300|i used to be hearing, but i went deaf when i was four-and-a-half years old.
1178939_a3041465|it doesn’t work with interpreters only.
1290126_a3241758|“that’s impossible, when i imagine the wall and the snipers, everything being guarded so well.”
1212416_a2480706|the owner is hearing.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2808781|she doesn’t know what deaf culture means because she isn’t integrated into the deaf world.
1206010_a2491323|but he was great as a teacher; especially how he included the parents in the deaf community center.
1250279_a2941080|i can, for example, set up a budget of 50€ and get notified once that money has been used up.
1177640_a3081090|the man gets angry.
1433543_a2983195|what else.
1211752_a2934048|but if there’s an offer/
1292768_a2386619|it was like that for one year, until i switched schools.
1430396_a3269593|i was usually with the deaf students and chatted to them.
1245462_a2319259|that was the easy and normal thing to do.
1184145_a2793382|there are a lot of, well, i am going to say frescoes on the wall, as well as a lot of images.
1181838_a2773357|i stared at the tv completely mesmerized, and the first weird thing i saw/
1206010_a2496950|i have the advantage there, right?
2025500_a3266431|i also told him that i, at times, have trouble with my arms.
1246102_a2819663|we ended up staying here in germany.
1413251_a3186104|i’m proud of having been born and grown up in germany.
1180097_a1683934|there is an intersection right behind my house. it is really dangerous there.
1184756_a3122754|he always staggered; it was so funny!
1209077_a2251636|now there are only a few students left, i'd consider having only one school in central germany.
1247525_a2531469|but it's no pleasure for me to walk around alone.
1427368_a3243278|that’s how it is at our company.
1250972_a2766149|he asked if i was willing to get an unrestricted employment contract.
1184536_a2730484|we’d have to get rid of our books, because our children have no use for them in the future, as they wouldn’t know how to read german anymore.
1250646_a3069356|right, it was handed out, i experienced just the same.
1204694_a2789537|if a person pees their pants or has problems with their mouth care, i have to notify the other nurse.
1205503_a2850636|even that's enough.
1431642-17445220-17471818_a3952319|you were able to take a look at assistive technology; they presented a variety of devices there.
1211752_a2941979|you’re always cold, but i’m usually warm.
1209077_a2251800|in my opinion.
1177702_a2871839|yes.
1251334_a3223145|secondly in high jump, exactly.
1180097_a1683923|yes, when you are a new driver, you are driving really accurately, but with time, you loosen up. it is like that with everybody.
1291243_a2380233|i adapted to them.
1210206-12000807-12040142_a2795242|the water almost reached us. horrible.
1182062_a2775423|you have lots of possibilities.
1205821_a2480607|maybe it's better to wait and see what comes to mind.
1430590_a2261932|i was mostly walking around with my sister, until i was old enough and independent.
1419607_a3389320|children who sign are wonderful, too!
1177860_a3021164|but they also don’t pay that many taxes in other countries.
1431896_a3003287|but changing the appointment in court to a later date?
1433410_a2384733|after that there is the question how we get up in the morning. that is what you said earlier.
1181159_a3225314|it’s all shit.
1183703_a2766008|yes.
1290581_a2935853|you couldn’t even see it in the bright light.
1251334_a3170574|there, we were selected to join the teams.
1427725_a2098891|they were hiding sticks which were attached to their feet underneath their flared skirt, so that one would walk normally.
1582841_a1783862|my old boss used to sell office furniture and computers.
1187152_a3074466|we need the second one for the fine tuning.
1585453_a1936537|you can do it already.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2897927|i’m telling you, i feel like it would be much harder if there weren’t any deaf people.
1432043_a3041123|you can also buy antiques there, old furniture and other stuff from olden times.
1430592_a2266304|i didn’t understand it.
1428472_a3228275|disabled people were only employed for cleaning. what to make of that?
1419607_a3389323|if i were able to hear with the help of a ci, i guess that would come with some psychological problems.
2021499_a2615110|that's it.
1181159_a3218499|my parents are deaf; they were great, they signed, and when i got home they always gave me everything i wanted.
1183203_a3127103|nice!
1249376_a2842278|i knew what atoms were.
1205568_a2886943|actually, it was the best workplace.
1205568_a2880693|they were small companies.
1290754_a3173387|300, 400 people with disabilities.
1413251_a2982861|the eu, for example, have recognized it, that’s already done.
1181159_a3225214|i would have had to pay it myself, and the ic is expensive.
1290121_a2769371|the jerseys were tighter in the gdr, more straight-lined.
1250059_a2521105|when my father told me about it, i replied/
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2404668|it's hard.
1419120_a3087060|and then the cat gets kicked out by the grandma.
1245154-15360102-15384713_a3075185|to boil the pasta, you fill a pot with water.
1204239_a3078574|my mother and my aunt are twins.
1248625-15324720-15465943_a2776732|yes, the little shrimp.
1178147_a2720398|the youth camp didn't exist before.
1418858_a2942770|i really like working there, i am able to move around and just be free.
1433543_a3295799|this will be the last year. they’re planning the ban for next year.
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3109549|we exchanged our experiences.
1211752_a2755759|we always go out to eat together anyway.
1181838_a2909549|he visited a school and sat among the school children.
1289793_a2958580|what exactly do they sell?
1247525_a2529144|in winter i do it maybe once a week in a hall.
1176407_a2883276|that's right.
1248505_a2747275|i let them go on their own which was ok for me.
1419610-11552205-12003930_a3400460|it was all about concentration, as simple as that.
1211752_a2749896|i think new year’s eve at my house would be nice.
1248400_a2789046|just like in switzerland.
1177002_a3252629|for me, that means that it‘s your perspective, that it is about yourself, isn‘t it?
2025500_a3270312|if it‘s the world cup, there will most likely be guests from all over the world in erfurt.
1246329_a2756034|lindenfels was a spa town back then.
1429781-12565132-12585506_a2357215|i asked him why he wanted to go to bavaria, and why he didn’t want to stay in the ruhr area?
1584855_a1994720|he opened the bonnet and he didn't believe his eyes.
1419370_a3317824|what was i supposed to do with that?
1204239_a3070963|my sister is #x years old, and her husband is #x.
1290581_a2937233|no, of course i traveled by myself.
1249951_a2761160|where is it?
1413485_a2129657|how interesting.
1210763_a2739734|i tried turtle in cuba.
1204877_a2938553|yes, that’s it.
1251308-15333326-15350303_a3082069|it was easy to find her with the mirror.
1178939_a3041407|especially the beginning needs time, of course.
1430590_a2264769|no, good.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a3113810|it doesn’t matter how much they can hear.
1180556_a2678171|yes, a green badge means, “i am environmentally friendly.”
1431896_a2996963|i was right.
1204239_a2623331|her father was the director of a #bank in name5.
1429709-16344227-16451821_a3280103|there were discussions and nagging.
1585089_a3094126|the klitschko family invited the boy’s family.
1209309-13425110-13472919_a2792458|now, you don’t stand a chance.
1431676_a3247636|voluntary work runs in my blood, and it is a lot of fun for me.
1182343_a1855937|and they get sad.
1291572_a2866016|i got used to paying attention and it became easy for me to get and understand a great amount of information at once.
1184756_a3131077|so, they joined it?
1179390-14072944-14151525_a2002194|at the moment, politicians are doing nothing at all.
1184749_a2782640|“i'm deaf myself.”
1206143_a3074013|it might be.
1584617_a3266938|
1184756_a3135424|time goes by so fast.
1177918_a2893801|knock on wood.
1204239_a2623266|no, no. #name10!
1247849_a2821273|it is difficult.
1184145_a2810207|it is on the first saturday.
1250721_a3314838|”one litre of milk, please.”
1428805_a3005832|i noticed that some of the tomatos there are shaped oddly.
1291243_a2379640|if i became a member i would receive a lot of information.
1419610-11552205-12003930_a3389009|even if i take something with me, they’ll still manage to follow me.
1289827-15544446-15594938_a3008686|yes, my granny signs it like this.
1200691_a2172446|we just left it at that.
1289462_a2398017|i'm sure it’s nice.
1584198_a2659960|that is exactly the same thing as with my class back in the day.
1184145_a2790091|anyway, it is not as important. but it is a flea market just with porcelain.
1584545_a2205254|they used to close the zoo during the winter and open it in the summer, or more specifically from spring to fall.
1413703_a2303839|a possible topic could be the soccer club comet and its former coach siegfried heins.
1582654_a3118743|
1291572_a2564676|ok, so they baptized the child and the other two, too.
1180097_a1682154|the turn signal was still on. did you still jerk the wheel around or did you turn?
1289793_a2952318|
1431896_a2998192|that is true.
1181011_a2012352|their rough edges were evened out until they looked pretty, just like cutting off the stray branches of a bush until it looks pretty.
1245462_a2372879|dgs [short for german sign language] caught the eye of many people.
1414563_a3030568|i found out that they also wanted to go.
1209077_a2255336|right, you go ahead and found a company and develop that then.
1249620_a2644942|if you look at their audiograms from the hearing tests, the line looks almost like that of hearing people.
1250721_a3788398|until i was 58 years old, then the company went bankrupt.
1430832_a2450009|supposedly, he was dead.
1289793_a2935343|was that good, with all those people around?
1427810_a3080114|39 cents is cheap, after all.
1177436_a3141991|the problem is:
1292770_a2914043|me too.
1251334_a3167553|leipzig was strong.
1178364_a2885622|i don't know that.
1205568_a2948379|and i often helped my mother with painting work, too.
1187154_a3077549|”hello, i’m home”, he says, already in a bad mood.
1427725_a2098056|those flared skirts simply expressed the character.
1418889_a2757844|i just didn't like it.
1182062_a2772540|i think seventeen.
1413251_a3029670|what would be the european main language?
1290581_a2933646|i’m normally pretty brave.
1210825_a3267605|i have a problem with them, and with foreigners as well.
1432043_a3042871|i was together with them, that’s true, so i’ve been there before.
1431896_a2996164|good.
1245356_a2772613|my aunt and my grandma wanted her to get more into contact with hearing people.
1176566_a1707666|did a lot of people sign up already?
1178133_a2899819|that was a big problem.
1182062_a2772558|the old town is really beautiful.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2894096|i had communication problems with my mother.
1181455_a2323336|going by bus is fine.
1427725_a2098008|the women started showing more leg through shorter skirts.
1430328_a2182335|the mine has elevators and some sorts of escalator.
1177278_a2865104|i wondered why; i thought they might have heard our boss flipping in another room.
1248941-12280641-12344740_a2930666|i know what you mean. it’s easy/
1212402_a2770451|it was mandatory. there were no exceptions made.
1585089_a3093396|i saw him and almost couldn’t believe it.
1204891_a2759100|i followed everything that was going on.
1583950_a3259016|after the club was established, more and more people became members and the club grew.
1427725_a2701309|but/
1244581_a2515323|it was terrible.
1178939_a3041392|but i still think something has to change in everyday life, too.
1211515_a3248264|at school i was able to tell others about all the stuff i had experienced over the break, stuff like that, you know. that was life back then.
1177436_a3152461|they don’t have to do twice the work there.
1184749_a2779207|it has its own origin and development.
1582654_a3124059|i do my research on the internet and take notes of everything.
1251334_a3174752|and then the final race.
1291243_a2382017|he thought it was great.
1181838_a2866181|ah, yes, a documentary.
1430328_a2873233|uhm.
1289793_a2943114|or/
1245820_a2862071|yet, if the other interpreter is there, they get nervous because he knows a lot about deaf culture and supports the deaf people.
1176846_a2893337|only with your own apartment.
1427368_a3242432|i personally don’t really like artificial insemination.
1177702_a2874487|the financial growth just doesn't fit.
1427810_a3037279|then, secondly, i thought/
1428472_a3228750|he started having kids early and it got better and better.
1181455_a2323326|well, that's just bad luck then.
1184756_a3093440|well, they have those badges there.
1249741_a2770999|
1205503_a2736433|the diversity of these different impressions is amazing.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a2699232|yes, that‘s it.
1177860_a3203019|”look, in the newspaper it says: a skyscraper, 800 meters high.”
1427368_a3242673|then i might be a doctor now, doctor #name1.
1427114-10034345-10053342_a2260386|so i‘ve kept going back and forth up until now.
1427368_a3243343|it was all fine.
1249620_a2618584|but in case of hearing aids they refuse.
1245390_a2783093|that’s a mistake.
1429064_a3081204|the others couldn’t believe it.
1291243_a2379334|she fell over with her wheeled walker, her money was stolen and gone.
1184749_a2781054|“you are deaf and came here?” he asked. “you can come here for vacation? wow.”
1584617_a3345239|
1206010_a2491510|i think a meeting with the colleagues would really help to detect misunderstandings.
1249951_a2766862|it's less busy to the west.
1413703_a2304810|it was bad luck. they got hammered the night before the semifinal and lost the match that took place the next day.
1427368_a3242559|deaf or hearing, that doesn’t matter. the important thing is that the child is healthy.
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2290048|yes, las vegas.
1250972_a2771875|that totally threw me off.
1248862_a2783237|that can be very different.
1184145_a2810064|have you been to leipzig yet?
1180097_a1684232|and you had to keep your balance?
1248699_a2740818|the plane crashed into the tower, and i saw how people were jumping down.
1245462_a2382240|for example, if you drive in a cab or go to the gas station.
1585089_a3116651|espenhain was also on that route.
1204694_a2789709|the local club is a little further away, that‘s why #name2 does‘t go there very often.
2025500_a3269191|however, we often host some, well, what to call them, guests. then it‘s a lot.
1180254_a2176511|before the time in essen, i have always been alone.
1184145_a2810231|yes, everything is open that day.
1180254_a2176713|they live a normal life today.
1583214_a1859928|but he followed my like a dog.
1428038_a2865827|so today/
1414312_a2771913|hungary was always likely to win and very strong.
1212611_a2778347|i feel like/
1289623_a2511176|a few years after, i wasn't a member of the theatre group anymore, because i was pregnant.
1212218_a2940046|
1245462_a2319129|it is different with the german sign language. it works a lot more with movements and upper bodywork.
1250646_a3071591|but they only gave us bed linen; i would have liked money much better.
1184536_a2487388|it sometimes happens like this.
1414312_a2777994|i will look after him.
1582841_a1783757|i finished my apprenticeship and worked for one year until i applied for correspondence courses.
1413251_a3029320|it should only be kept for difficult words.
1177640_a3079316|somebody is climbing up a ladder, which is leaning against the tree.
1431896_a2996850|that‘s a good question.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2942174|he didn’t know what i meant, and i didn’t find the right words.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2992758|so, we went all the way up.
1183203_a3160909|i do ask myself what it was like with all the spoken language; i can‘t remember.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a3105788|the school for the deaf used to be at a different place. now, the school for the hard of hearing and the school for the deaf share a location.
1184749_a2769320|i'm just deaf, it's my thing."
1204694_a2790683|this way, i’m happy i’ve gotten rid of it.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a3857432|so, we were lucky enough to be able to sneak in.
1250279_a3118210|i thanked them for the information. very short: thank you for the information.
1249620_a2643541|hearing aids are inferior.
1177436_a3147008|alas.
1430328_a2175206|the schnitzel makes the difference.
1212402_a2774772|therefore i transferred to another department where i felt more comfortable.
1431488_a3229115|it has a wooden plank and a heavy weight.
1176340_a2132321|i worked for one company, you see, but i got an offer from another, where a lot of deaf people worked.
1182801_a1941824|the bank then loans that person 110,000 dollars, even.
1433410_a2904728|yes.
1177436_a3134249|he told all the other interpreters about it.
1200689_a2166844|at the school for the hard of hearing people we used sign language, and during the private lessons we had to speak.
1429781-12565132-12585506_a2357206|he went to university there.
1210825_a3259342|the hearing test candidates had needed much longer. that was the end of my exam.
1212176_a2752124|i could see other deaf peoples' culture - that is a nice memory.
1176407_a2877856|imagining that one of us could be involved makes it emotionally even more challenging than watching it on tv.
1249376_a2842608|i don’t remember what was printed exactly.
1182062_a2775401|you'll find it on the internet. you can find anything there.
1210825_a3129029|so he accompanied me.
1211531_a2047272|in the west nothing has been restored so far.
1212218_a2958591|he/ yes, i have a friend there.
1419124_a3095417|the cat follows the bird.
1178939_a3035851|there are a lot of those.
1582654_a3096451|i don‘t watch it on tv.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2899670|i don't know.
1431896_a3010432|finally someone knew sign language.
1247205_a2239685|that would have been it.
1247849_a2791589|ah yes, it was in 1963.
1209746_a2023240|i should have helped them, but the communication and all the hurry-scurry and so on.
1247641_a2723278|i feel no need to smoke.
1428472_a3228272|where else should the 30 people go [probably meant to say 300]?
1246681_a3260938|but today, #name1 is the #name4 district of the city of ludwigshafen.
1180254_a2172207|with these articulation exercises: a, b, and so on.
1418903_a2899593|later he even showed me the kumpelnest 3000 [bar in berlin], all of this was new to me.
1290754_a3171309|it was founded in 1967 and it still exists today.
1204694_a2790689|i also tell her how/
1177436_a3017605|but if there’s ten they can communicate. that’s not too bad.
1204891_a2760594|i would have loved to touch him.
1584617_a3282051|
1209910_a2860042|where is it going to be in four years?
1246772_a3721843|yes.
1176846_a2884320|you could wear sleeveless clothes and didn't need a jacket.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2809370|the teachers knew lbg [signed german], and the signs were what’s important.
1246100_a2729021|yes.
1585453_a1938443|and then the awards ceremony.
1212176_a2471690|your father wanted to encourage you.
1429964_a2205718|my daughter kept complaining that everything was so tremendously easy in first and second grade.
1205821_a2460632|do we continue talking about this topic or should we take the fall of the berlin wall?
1289462_a2396102|on the right side, i heard normally.
1245462_a2319257|one used to drink unhurried and today they drink their drinks very fast, for example vodka straight is usually drunk in one quick slug.
1413251_a3058386|i think it’d be better that way.
1204694_a2790562|when we got back down, one woman started to have problems walking and linked arms with me.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2789829|at the sessions there, i sometimes grabbed a cigarette and then it got more and more.
1249542_a2776902|the company csd is similar to the deutsche telekom (german telecommunications company).
1182343_a1856686|i was sceptical.
1246329_a2761969|then i saw two men in green rubber coats.
1244581_a2515372|it depends on how far away the shore is.
1291572_a2693734|interesting.
2025500_a3264423|we discussed it in advance at a meeting of the regional association; we even considered doing it in berlin only.
1414312_a2772477|i support my son no matter if he wins the goldene hand award or comes in any other position.
1430328_a2178740|i could drive there with you.
1182517_a2337445|the sisters were only pleased when you had prayed.
1205503_a2850622|that was very interesting, yes.
1250966_a2503483|yes. yes, of course, but i've already talked about that.
1211515_a3248793|yes, that‘s right.
1428472_a3219060|they shouldn’t be destroyed, no.
1585089_a3127672|one flew there early in the morning.
1584198_a2659982|yes, those are usually enterprises.
1430590_a2256694|is your sister deaf, as well?
1181159_a3281392|i thought, “what the heck do i have to do with it?”
1205568_a2880616|that’s how a spot opened up for me.
1210825_a3187341|my mother indicated that the other children also couldn’t hear, that they were just like me.
1419124_a3095385|how will the cat do it?
1413251_a2975626|do you think the euro-language is already fixed and recognized?
1205821_a2504499|what was it again?
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2813959|in front of the two windows there were curtains pulled closed.
1209910_a3204833|you could add on to your house.
1427810_a2456686|then it’s done.
1428805_a3042282|but i never stayed over night.
1178347_a2900067|
1431676_a3250199|i‘m able to do that now.
1291572_a2693812|i instantly knew that it would suit me.
1247835_a2604952|i didn't need to get up early.
1211515_a3240047|you didn’t really learn anything there.
1176407_a2878475|many of the texts were really, really sad.
1204691_a2847213|that’s why.
1211515_a3247465|so, i was sent off to business school.
1428472_a3228025|with the hearing aid i was able to hear some distorted noises, but i couldn’t understand anything.
1184164_a2902477|swimming.
1292770_a2386795|i went there carrying my suitcase, anxiously clinging to my mom and dad.
1289793_a2940722|there’s soft seating and if it gets cold you can grab a blanket.
1244796_a3084241|i’ve already made a list of signs that originated in oral influences.
1245390_a2782698|i hope i didn’t get too off topic.
1179389_a3530682|yes.
1246102_a2816424|i knew that, as a deaf person, i had to stay strong and fight through it.
1429310_a2261394|yes, to this very day the record of that year still stands.
1432043_a3042843|that area.
1210825_a3189260|i also noted that i can speak well and can still hear a bit.
1582205_a2041086|it's a huge difference really, as if there were still a wall.
1290126_a3233197|of course, i don’t know how they paid for all that back in the gdr. maybe that also ruined them financially.
1181455_a2302594|healthy/
1431690_a2172915|for me these things are natural disasters.
1248505_a2851302|i started reading and it really was true.
1179212_a2880845|how did you find out about his death?
1413451-11105600-11163240_a2856755|there were so many deaf people at the boarding school.
1178939_a3011928|one would be shocked to discover that sign language exists.
1181602_a3095240|my academic performance got worse, because i couldn’t really study at school.
1245356_a2772447|many of them had lost their hearing.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a3175110|perfect!
1292770_a2393921|yet, i was really happy when she sent me a package.
1428805_a3036501|the doctor looked at me like i was drunk.
1584617_a3264584|
1205821_a2492438|no one was environmentally friendly there.
1177918_a2879755|then they asked themselves where they could drop this all-consuming bomb.
1427810_a3033109|are you going to go shopping by yourself or should we do it as a group?
1584545_a2284316|actually, no. we have a huge bowl with potato salad and of that we have plenty.
1212218_a2958501|then, they asked me to fill in the form. so i filled it in and took it with me to the airport.
1251334_a3182899|on mondays one wore a blue shirt.
1291572_a2866117|oh, yes.
1177860_a3189806|you mean tim.
1177860_a3021166|but the economy here is doing fine.
1248090_a2700313|i had my family first and then/
1181602_a3086543|we kept going and finally we got sign language, lucky us.
1206010_a2497452|i barely got anything out that was coherent. only something like, “the people in afrika are poor.”
1427810_a3042535|yes.
1427368_a3242479|there are cases like that.
1292770_a2394008|i had finished master school by the time i turned 28 years.
1249620_a2599012|who would pay for the interpreter?
1184756_a3122746|we laughed a lot. that was nice.
1183203_a3916241|awareness for the need of sign language might increase then.
1183720-17021701-17054739_a2757285|they mainly served asparagus as food.
1205821_a2504721|the ones remaining in the gdr, like my uncle.
1250059_a2478942|they still know about what happened to some of their classmates back then.
1433410_a2383824|dealing with deaf people in the usa, for example, is totally normal.
1249376_a2843135|no, what would happen to the economy and the companies?
1414123_a2766842|though i didn't actually manage to go.
1244581_a2514922|he told me the number of dead people had now increased to 80,000.
1177918_a2881322|one can only hope that it will be the same in cape town, in africa.
1182343_a1857496|i was glad that we skipped the other topics, and i left quickly.
1414503_a2934144|yes, on the phone, they suddenly said someone would come immediately.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2814004|we were quite flustered and tried to talk our way out of it.
1183426_a2788167|after one or two days it got better.
1419797_a2745814|i often thought of hearing people as puppets, and that i should ignore them.
1184145_a2793330|how interesting.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2886803|people should stay natural.
1209309-13425110-13472919_a2793231|from america, from russia; the oktoberfest is interesting to them, it’s world-famous.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2000236|i had to go to speech therapy to practice speaking.
1419370_a3277852|
1291572_a2693778|you can't force someone.
1244581_a2516062|i caught they are already building new towers in new york.
1210206-11564230-11595227_a2786706|even though we were in germany and he was in america, he was very popular.
1212218_a2990795|they also use those full body scanners.
1180556_a2684303|if you replaced every 40-watt light bulb for an eight-watt light bulb, you would save a lot of energy.
1247525_a2558136|the deaf sports club founded the tennis club.
1187218_a3132458|the doctor saw that with respect to all my answers and measurements, i was in a good, healthy condition.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2899791|i am happy with the way things are.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767725|we are together for 11 years now and i want to get married.
1291243_a2380239|we didn’t exchange profound thoughts, just some light-hearted conversation.
1430396_a3269558|because amongst the hard of hearing students there/
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2814319|we didn’t have any bread rolls.
1291243_a2381092|and, should you take unpaid vacation, what would your pension look like in the future?
1292086_a2484743|it was hard for me.
1290581_a3243672|
1249620_a2689250|he/she would have to be very active him/herself and try to understand as much as possible with his/her hearing aids.
1250646_a3022234|f6.
1430832_a2450372|
1247205_a2239691|an injury on your body - on your back or elsewhere - would have been worse.
1212218_a3012184|i was so quick because they had accompanied me.
1182062_a2773311|the dutch princess had four c-sections.
1179868_a2570784|even until/ the water is supposed to be able to reach frankfurt.
1418903_a2911380|i can't really say anything about that.
1246102_a2792104|they let me switch the kindergarten. i was really happy to get to go there.
1248862_a2785045|where should my parents get the money from?
1209077_a2255131|most of them like chattering, partying.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2299426|in lower saxony?
1204239_a3069825|#name3, that’s his name.
1432043_a3042731|normally, we don’t get real snow, it’s just cold and you get depressive.
1413925_a2795686|i don’t really know any details, sadly.
1212218_a2970274|ua stands for united america. it’s an american airline.
1290121_a2767624|you can find many documentaries that show this story and reruns of the matches.
1211515_a3247235|finally, i found a job as a typesetter.
1246100_a2739801|that’s how that went.
1414123_a2768125|maybe you want to join and help me?
1184367_a2568165|people are still wondering about the mona lisa, but are lost eventually.
1248505_a2747307|and of course, i was right, nobody lived there!
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2299409|it must be 650,000. bremerhaven has a population of 150,000, and bremen has 500,000 inhabitants.
1204191_a2816476|i remember the strict education, all those pranks we did, being little rascals, and so much more.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2396125|if there are people who want to use sign language and are interested in it, it will remain.
1184367_a2581046|because there aren't many deaf people; it's a small group.
1183846_a2963643|from all the theater plays i had seen so far, this one outdid them all.
1177278_a2865137|“did they have a fight with the boss?” i asked myself. “ah well, whatever.”
1187218_a3121777|that’s that rhesus factor or whatever it’s called.
1250646_a3097011|no.
1419607_a3394680|that is why we went to the advice center in neukölln, in the paster-behrens street.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a2010853|they are wrong, though. if you look behind the facade, you see how it really is.
1419797_a2743767|yes, most of the time. that's true.
1418903_a2902026|he sure was cute.
1427810_a3024384|but that’s not important, i’ve understood that in this context.
1430592_a2269527|so i wanted to wait a little longer.
1413925_a2817330|back then one was rather helpless.
1204691_a2787377|yesterday, during the 4x100m race, the women lost.
1248505_a2750029|yes!
1427810_a3079992|yes.
1178347_a2884504|she was a very lovable women, isn't that true?
1429310_a2261351|that was in denmark, no, sorry, that was at the world games in sofia in 1993 where we were mad because of the loss. we almost couldn't believe it.
1176566_a1705435|i don't know if it will stay that way in the department.
1418903_a2896975|then i was fed up with him so to speak, i knew him inside out, how he behaved in terms of his style of signing and everything, and so we began to see each other less.
1419797_a2744214|i could do everything i wanted because i wasn't accompanied by my parents. i was free to do anything.
1584411_a2147650|it doesn't matter.
1182062_a2771655|yes, i know, i’ve heard about it.
1583043_a2763496|no, wrong. i think that the association for the deaf and hard of hearing of the gdr got a lot of money from the state.
1413251_a3055076|and at university, everyone would know the same sign language, no matter if they’re from france or england.
1413683_a2973512|you have the choice.
1247205_a2239189|i am not sure, maybe, the driver was a foreigner, or he wasn't happy with his car and hoped that someone would hit his car by accident.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2914845|people talked about it among themselves, but they never told us deaf people.
1183203_a3160784|that‘s my opinion.
1427368_a3242913|why isn’t that also done for us? i don’t understand it.
1250721_a3348760|that was in 1990, and back then i thought they would fire me afterwards.
1212611_a2779212|i moved there and they only spoke completely orally.
1250279_a2938387|my husband is hard of hearing, he can’t always help me, either.
1247835_a2612769|i was never a fan of clubs.
1177918_a2875175|the hair on their arms and whole body fell out.
1428905_a2427809|of course, you feel sorry for the people.
1418889_a2759093|
1291164_a3115743|there used to be a lot of old people but now there are more young people there.
1204239_a3071059|but he is not completely sick yet.
1178347_a2897772|even the father, i mean her father-in-law was there.
1414312_a2778011|i wasn't able to stay there.
1249965-15581230-16013736_a3136072|once the cake is prepared, you can put it into the oven.
1428472_a3227960|no, a ci is not good.
1210206-11564230-11595227_a2786682|through the newspapers/ sorry.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2884261|americans can come here, you know.
1184536_a2430179|just think about how much money is wasted on interpreters.
1177860_a3021194|yes, it’s better to only construct flat buildings.
1250721_a3323145|they were always surprised when they asked me: ”you don’t hear anything?”
1427725_a2903569|yes.
1250721_a3315216|for example at a meeting, or a meeting of advisors.
1292086_a2485092|some teachers attended a retraining program.
1212611_a2781730|i answered indifferently, “yes, everything’s okay.“
1413485_a2132054|no, i meant if he was there at the memorial but he just said he wasn't.
1205821_a2485112|it simply was a shock for many of them.
1248090_a2699630|they didn‘t; they only knew dutch and dutch signs.
1246344_a2465324|that's the way it was.
1206010_a2491361|
1182135_a2750568|no way, i only watched it.
1245356_a2772402|my parents are deaf.
1291638_a3102015|they had to commute.
1180097_a1683903|oh, him! the bigmouth, right?
1428805_a3035477|one couldn’t see it, i didn’t have a bump on my neck or anything.
1427725_a2117957|they ask you about your personal goals and why you want to accomplish them.
1250721_a3358973|i moved to rostock and said good-bye.
1290126_a3257020|the person who told the story didn’t know whether they survived.
1419797_a2743870|his internal work is also terrific.
1246329_a2762605|we waited for the parachutes to go by and then the train went on to frankfurt main.
1178147_a2720414|the camp is really, really good.
2021499_a2546737|i'd always have to think back to this, my whole life.
1427810_a2456732|yes, yes, 25 euros.
1429310_a2256490|that way one stays young and active.
1209746_a2023132|people saw the tsunami approaching them and ran away.
1428225_a2158715|but now it doesn't bark very often.
1180556_a2556734|
1582654_a3103442|i was then allowed to go to the front and into the cockpit.
1182062_a2775375|it doesn't matter, though, once i’m retired, i might go to hamburg again to look around.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2899759|i/
1413925_a2817497|that’s when it got even worse.
1414503_a2773595|we were talking about whether we should go shopping or to my mother’s house first.
1419370_a3283610|for minor things.
1433543_a2983229|but the others can’t be sold at oktoberfest. only beers from munich can be sold there.
1585453_a1936671|you were there too!
1431277-12504848-12590316_a3112833|you sit in front of the screen and type away.
1291892_a2157138|here in germany, people demonstrate well-behaved in the streets with their banners and nice posters and sign songs.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2901319|i’m open to everyone, and it’s my concern that the deaf — i mean hearing people get informed.
1289462_a2397728|that got the federal government thinking, as the green party is a threat for them now.
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2400206|i don't really know.
1419607_a3405427|the topic of nuclear energy in other countries is a tender subject.
1249741_a2773996|it's not quite finished yet.
1413251_a3177060|yes.
1431690_a2172966|i landed there and a week later came the flood.
1419265_a2974187|that’s true.
1419797_a2743871|he is the second chairman, do you know thomas geißler?
1584411_a2202682|yes, one brother who is hearing, just like the rest of the family.
1292770_a2386749|i struggled.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3151241|i looked around for some wool.
1292768_a2364040|i see, your story started very early.
1431896_a3010586|not enough people know how to sign.
1427810_a3077297|she can call her sister.
1584198_a2659965|education never ends, it continues forever.
1246100_a2739786|it develops through time, there’s always a new chair as well.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2894093|i went home most weekends.
1414503_a2778960|he was surprised that the doctor had told me i really needed to take the pills. then he went home.
1585089_a3124341|i’ve now experienced it once.
1427114-10034345-10053342_a2260668|we acted as if we didn't know anything and that was what saved us in the end.
1179389_a3530708|i am done.
1585089_a3103209|the bowling department was most strongly represented.
1180097_a1708959|the whole car was shaking. i was driving more towards the middle of the road because there were no other cars around.
1585089_a3096925|haye.
1414312_a2766510|the team didn't bring home any medals.
1210763_a2739715|you are also able to try out new local dishes in the different countries.
1248862_a2780972|but you couldn’t look at everything.
1246329_a2763418|maybe.
1419265_a2971920|it’s not because of the relationship but rather because of the circumstances.
1248862_a2788352|before, my field of vision was more restricted, and i couldn’t see that.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2903800|i told my mom, “the woman is crazy; she says the cat doesn’t go baa, but meow.”
1433543_a2983223|the breweries in munich aren’t that old.
1210825_a3187840|i wanted to go to realschule, but unfortunately i had to drop out because my right hand was in a cast.
1413683_a2561035|my grandfather had been a salesman in hungary during the first world war and was stuck there.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2899338|the hearing person said something to me, but i obviously couldn’t hear it.
1249131-10284534-10424015_a2813860|i was gone for a long time.
1212416_a2480525|everyone agreed on that.
2025500_a3270321|yes, i‘ve been there before.
1248090_a2695966|it‘s true. fc bayern munich was playing at the time.
1429964_a2206619|nice.
1418889_a2757956|the hearing students were sitting in front of him and there was one additional teacher.
1583882_a1976784|one is able to send texts without charge.
1245356_a2772519|she signed unintelligibly.
1179212_a2880830|it’s been more than a year now since we could last sit down with him and talk about anything and everything.
1420216_a2755173|
1184089_a2773026|her age/
1212416_a2476809|it was so interesting to sign with him.
1289623_a2511188|when i took my baby break, my theatre group was in israel.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2894030|i was still bad at articulating, though, and had to keep practicing.
1180724_a2678581|also/
1429709-16344227-16451821_a2467395|… about 40 countries.
1182343_a3040778|but i feel like/
1211082-13131933-13230433_a2699233|i see. so, it‘s a rectangle and like that and that.
1247199_a2196787|the grandparents wanted to secure their children's and grandchildren's future.
1290121_a2769299|we lost in the end, and it was over.
1431224_a2153735|so he flew.
1247205_a2212320|he asked me to accompany him upstairs into a large room, which was probably the office.
1248400_a2752042|the debts he has to deal with are getting worse and worse, they are bankrupt too.
1289623_a2511289|uli hase was also there.
1249376_a2843068|how would that work?
1428225_a2156929|i started to take the school bus to get to school when i was eight or nine years old.
1204691_a2803886|thomas zander often visited muhs and signed for him.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2819439|there are a lot of people with cis.
1178939_a2977369|they only spoke amongst themselves.
1176407_a2884926|it's not supposed to be removed, because of it being so memorable.
1211752_a2755768|you ate those.
1187218_a3132436|the doctor said that my temperature was fine.
1289793_a2981821|which gym?
1247199_a2209721|we can read it as soon as it is published.
1176340_a2364187|in that group were three people.
1180254_a2172598|no.
1250646_a3069764|but many were part of the state security.
1432043_a2962283|it’s more modern, so you have to pay more.
1247525_a2531764|sometimes i went alone and sometimes with others together.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3148298|they had a poster up on the wall, and it said which courses they would give.
1184536_a2436759|i'm obviously in favor of having a standardized sign language in germany.
1976261_a2238532|my son slept on the bottom bunk.
1583322-12534537-13002913_a3002352|if the children have deaf parents, they can usually sign as well.
1209910_a2984153|but i don’t remember the year anymore.
1413703_a3522566|the deaf guy’s shop is to the right.
1245597_a3080205|it’s almost night.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2960606|now game suspensions following a red card shall no longer be valid for friendly matches.
1177292_a2276357|it is a timing issue, as it would take too long otherwise.
1413232_a3115230|the cat rushes after it.
1432043_a3037659|do you know nordstrand? [literally: north beach]
1211752_a2745772|i think i’ll go to stuttgart.
1431642-17445220-17471818_a3952173|well, i went there as the representative of the association.
1181240-15572825-16003603_a3191831|also, i prepare the sandwiches they eat during break.
1212218_a2935394|it’s like that all the way to the core of the building. all the beams on the ceiling, and the walls and floors are completely smooth.
1248400_a2752414|they have built a good economy, really nice.
1176566_a1706078|and she is right about that.
1290581_a3115950|i think it is quite similar in both places.
1211752_a2959460|it opens its mouth, with those sharp teeth, so that i can see the uvula.
1247205_a2239715|yes, he was super friendly.
1211531_a2824156|in berlin, east and west were now unified.
1427725_a2115331|i think it's deeply rooted in culture.
1177278_a2865877|and i realized this was a terror attack.
1204239_a2623305|you can really be glad about that.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2820419|if you were able to understand something with that, then yes, but if you don’t get anything, it’s senseless.
1433543_a3025544|…weisswurst, right; leberkäse [type of meat loaf]/
1205503_a2766148|one man can also love many women in different ways. no need to get married or anything.
1204694_a2790835|they can’t really do sports.
1291638_a3101841|the headmaster, a fräulein [german title for an unmarried young woman, equivalent to miss; dated] and a third teacher who was also a fräulein.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2886787|it doesn't help.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2884233|you can add new words for the european sign language, and call it — let’s say — eug.
1177702_a2868251|they play there a lot.
1427368_a3231948|that is a small benefit, but there also are disadvantages.
1251334_a3856902|so for example the erfurt team was marching in and was led by someone holding up a sign that said „deaf school erfurt“.
1178147_a2738175|people get sent there if they show a good performance.
1418903_a2896871|we also worked out together.
1250646_a3097349|that’s what he used to say.
1209746_a2023146|the people couldn't get out anymore after the tsunami arrived.
1430832_a2450111|i think, the first time that i heard about the news was through the msn-chat service. the news were already spread widely on the internet. one could read articles and such about it.
1209077_a2254399|it's better now, of course, than it has been in the past.
1292545_a2517891|communicating with them won't work.
1181455_a2323289|
1250059_a2481550|people who didn't want to live in the gdr could only get out of the country by taking a detour.
1584545_a2842868|we usually walked from one to the other.
1249620_a2651628|when they got older and came to leipzig for instance, they took off the damned thing.
1210825_a3263842|the land surveyor’s office also has easier tasks to offer.
1250646_a3022230|that’s true. i’ve noticed the same.
1418903_a2902066|i mean, i went to the theater with him.
1250972_a2771415|he just said i wouldn't need any, that i'd be just fine without gloves.
1427368_a3243386|i thought that was strange.
1209910_a3217265|afterwards i missed a couple more things, until i finally joined again for the european championship in bamberg.
1419130_a3100031|through a looking glass, the cat takes measurements of the window with the cage and keeps on planing.
1180724_a2678819|that way the child is able to perceive more spatially, which is a big advantage for the child.
1184089_a2764406|diana was very popular and he didn't like that.
1184536_a2487381|in hamburg, i was asked what a ‘maß‘ was.
1427810_a3044537|it’ll be quite the pile.
1180724_a2678597|but they have to explain it.
1291164_a2457636|yes, it was really crowded but it is getting less and less.
1976261_a2238502|yes, i felt at ease then as well.
1419370_a3290736|i wrote down that i would have to cancel the test because i couldn’t understand the interpreter well enough and communication with him was just not right.
1976261_a2212634|at a birthday party somebody asked me when she was supposed to be home. she replied, „my mother said i had to be home by eight.“
1585089_a3122093|39€ with a disabled person’s pass.
1582654_a2659401|yes. it was my first time flying for such a long period of time, nine hours.
1182062_a2775391|you can find it on the internet.
1177436_a3141898|but it really wasn’t that bad.
1583964_a2118820|dessau, do you know it?
1413683_a2706707|if you didn't win, winning the title wasn't possible for a longer time.
1418889_a2707189|back in the gdr the fuse boxes were constructed rather simply.
1247199_a2209757|nobody knows.
1419370_a3283918|he just told me to rather use the left arm. i couldn’t contain myself and had to laugh.
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2909594|yes, that's what i did back then.
1585089_a3116830|there was smoke rising.
1431676_a3291766|is it here in cologne?
1212218_a2934140|yes, it’s a miracle, four all/
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2960241|following the new rules, we would play in north rhine-westphalia against you, dusseldorf, for example.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a3742510|one will be blocked for the following matches and has to wait for the next real match.
1584855_a1993592|but i still had east german mark with me.
1289462_a2397896|it's possible that everything already got poisoned by it.
1206010_a2491390|they don't even try.
1182517_a2343895|only simple gestures were used.
1292458_a3024011|i’m like you in that regard, i think.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2805056|if i try to talk to them, they arrogantly look away.
1179390-14072944-14151525_a2010881|some of the experts who know what's behind the numbers, see more, though.
1211752_a2755561|can i tell the kofo organizers myself which topic i want to talk about?
1249620_a2700497|there was no pressure.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2208490|what other companies are there?
1244796_a3084381|it was hard mental labour for me.
1182343_a1856826|he showed us a lot of things.
1209077_a2249242|i'm telling you, deaf people will never die out.
1248090_a2695637|i hadn‘t planned for it. yet, i did have some savings.
1244978_a2430856|yes, i translated for him, like an interpreter.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2819158|but still, when i look at it today, wow.
1414563_a2987748|are your parents deaf?
1205821_a2463585|but talking about the wall is probably interesting, as well.
1248862_a2783680|my friend apologized so much for her mistake, she felt really bad and helped me back up.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2960586|it was during the north-rhine westphalia indoor soccer game, during the qualification match.
1247800_a3077727|you’re supposed to write that down.
1413451-11171532-11201836_a2859154|well, i was too lazy to hear, and i/
1247205_a2239110|it was parked right there on the street.
1248941-12280641-12344740_a2933333|no.
1584855_a1993203|it was quite last-minute.
1248090_a2696162|it‘s a different thing.
1428472_a3219270|it should remain as it was in the past.
1248699_a2756695|you personally — do you think the power plants should be shut down or should everything stay the same?
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2992704|yet, the seats for people with disabilities in the east stand are really bad.
1249542_a2758645|a lot of people came to the opening ceremony, maybe around 10,000 people.
1177860_a3201879|but it’s freezing outside at the moment.
1248090_a2696043|if it‘s going to change in the future? who knows.
1428472_a3228051|i refused strictly.
1292086_a2463187|i never went to kindergarten; i started school right away.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2298556|
1178347_a2900403|it was as if i needed her.
1246681_a3257067|sometimes, it has sad reputation, though.
1180254_a2988006|but it is impossible to exchange thoughts about a certain topic.
1176407_a2897347|it's been almost nine years now.
1427725_a2118228|
1180556_a2678158|what do the colours mean?
1182062_a2772522|it is open from/ until 7 p.m. and/
1248862_a2783942|one deaf guy sat close and waved at me, but i didn’t see him.
1187152_a3074099|so yes, i’m free on monday from twelve o’clock.
1181455_a2302440|for me/
1248862_a2781548|i had to go back to husum with the others.
1291892_a2032727|the same reaction over and over again, now how could that happen?
1209309-13425110-13472919_a2790303|everything is clean there.
1427114-10034345-10053342_a2260604|i just lifted it up and let it fall down so that it burst really loudly on the floor.
1176407_a2876408|i guess that would be quite hard.
1428038_a2864515|during the moon landing, the astronauts were wearing space suits that supplied oxygen.
1180339-16161232-16363818_a2179207|you can go biking or skating, as well.
1290126_a3240690|well, his wife‘s brother, or the sister, i’m not sure.
1246772_a2387001|if i may ask.
1212611_a2781649|two weeks later we received the results, whether it had gone well or badly.
1249951_a2764697|you can go for a walk in the forest, as well.
1292770_a2386827|“mum.“
1247525_a2531893|but i don't have one.
1211531_a2819418|there was this, oh what was it called again, solidarity supplement which they subtracted from your salary.
1176846_a2890658|2010.
1413242_a3135247|next to the bird, the old lady is cheering it on.
1184367_a2568155|i looked at the painting and i couldn't say for sure. it's incredibly hard.
1212176_a2752095|yes, still.
1584855_a1995008|our 400 mark weren't quite enough.
1413251_a2975685|interestingly, the news there are in mandarin, but they communicate internationally in english.
1210825_a3267610|i’m glad to get the elderly people out of the room when i’m done.
1247205_a2243951|is it the same boyfriend?
1248699_a2740769|but we didn’t know what exactly.
1206010_a2485595|i couldn't make it during the week because i was in school.
1289623_a2511349|we were invited to perform our theatre play there; the rest wasn't my concern.
1246566_a3065102|i think that the usual separation is better.
1250059_a2482533|however, they fought for getting one earlier on.
1427810_a3041620|go out for dinner comfortably and pleasantly just once.
1419370_a3334358|if he wants to go to the us for his studies, financing that could become extremely expensive for me.
1583882_a1976823|exactly. just like hearing people make a quick call –which we can't do. we can just send a message really quick, that's right.
1291636_a3085474|at some point, the alarm went off and we were shocked because only 20 minutes later, the planes were already there.
1211082-13131933-13230433_a3157186|then, it is held together down here with a brooch.
1210763_a2902600|exactly!
1178939_a2977433|i didn’t have a lot to do with hearing people.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2907510|that's how i learn about other opinions.
1177436_a3186016|unfortunately that’s the way it is.
1177860_a3202746|in japan they build houses in a way that they can move with the vibrations.
1430328_a2174402|and at every single one you could try different specialties.
1251308-15333326-15350303_a3078063|i think that especially his expression was typical for a deaf person.
1180724_a2661947|they are simply deaf.
1427368_a3242315|i have never heard of artificial insemination. what is that?
1431896_a2979808|exactly.
1247199_a2196393|is that right? what do you think?
1206010_a2497036|it is not always an advantage though.
1200691_a2172397|we did so secretly, though, so they wouldn’t get mad.
1429310_a2261406|no one has beaten that record so far.
1183426_a2673355|yeah, we came there at the same time.
1220195_a2041237|… would be better to implant a ci, because they'd cope with everything more easily then.
1249620_a2689322|easy as that the implant breaks and the child does not hear anything anymore.
1245154-15360102-15384713_a3075168|then you add the bay leaves, i always take two.
1204691_a2803767|for others it might be a problem to understand the signs, but i understand them all equally well.
1249302_a2987696|but playing skat the whole day, from morning to evening, sitting down the entire time - and then there’s the award ceremony that takes place throughout half the night- that’s exhausting.
1289462_a2395987|not on the right.
1428225_a2157638|i am just used to do that.
1584855_a1998317|my wife woke up, too.
1245356_a2772575|she then continued speaking while i was just sitting next to her.
1181602_a3086619|the food at school was pretty good, much like at home.
1414123_a2766866|there are just no younger people.
1248090_a2695671|then, i was bored and read the deutsche gehörlosenzeitung [monthly german magazine for the deaf; lit. german deaf newspaper].
1181397_a2256327|then, the vopo [colloquial for 'deutsche volkspolizei', english: german people's police] came and took him away. they were too late - he was dead already.
1419370_a3277907|if for example he can’t make it to my doctor’s appointment, i will communicate with the doctor writing notes. that works as well.
1292086_a2485105|the school for the deaf must improve their teaching, just like you said before.
1178133_a2899841|the drains were clogged with all of the waste.
1418858_a2933273|and that’s the way the deaf clubs are supposed to be kept alive.
1247641_a2723282|i think/ i don't like when people smoke while walking on the streets.
1431277-12422631-12464143_a2471123|well, not anymore.
1413925_a2821166|but/
1292545_a2517963|as soon as i arrived, everyone was looking at me: i was the center of attention.
1176846_a2884298|there was a convertible that/
1427810_a3047704|or is that prohibited and one has to be naked?
1247205_a2212327|it's mostly the foreigners that speak extremely well.
1419610-11552205-12003930_a3411564|yet another one had to stand with his back crooked and arms bend.
1290754_a3203432|did it work with the finance that was going on as a trial.
1247641_a2967612|you would need a pane of glass which would be held up between the two of us so we could have a smoke-free conversation.
1250721_a3360807|sure, those are the problems elderly people have.
1250646_a3022198|then he left and continued exercising.
1292125_a2071532|i have one question/
1183426_a2797980|no, at hourly intervals.
1178939_a3002833|i’m not only thinking about deaf people.
1419607_a3414759|i would love for that knowledge to spread far and wide, yes.
1181397_a2248873|he thought they were bad off without their father. that's why he wanted to do everything for them.
1205168_a2742099|yes, then the people looked at us funny.
1209006_a2563663|that was during round of sixteen, no it was during the quarter-finals when we fought for third place.
1291572_a2693811|my husband had a look at it and thought it was interesting, too.
1180724_a2690085|the brochures should be lain out in the different doctor's offices?
1292458_a2986751|as i said already, the difference between the city and the country is noticeable in photos, already.
1428038_a2143472|i watched it closely.
1176846_a2884344|they put the money in the garter.
1178939_a3035572|and what would the lessons look like?
1248862_a2783949|“yes, what is it?”
1181455_a2329172|i feel unsure sometimes.
1204694_a2789546|that’s the difference between the younger generation and their uncertain future and the older one.
1181838_a2897921|what is it called, the thing in front of the reporter, the reporter table or the table for the anchor?
1182517_a2337452|we had to wash the dishes only in the evening, nothing more than that.
1419265_a3097126|then, she randomly runs into her affair and realizes she still has feelings for him.
1584411_a2129206|but at the moment i am okay with searching a job as dental technician.
1205503_a2772471|he was so fed up with it; it had to be over, enough is enough.
1419370_a3317825|true, not all are the same.
1431642-17445220-17471818_a3952397|i might attend those in erfurt. maybe i’ll go to the culture days there; we’ll see. i want to take another look at it first, though.
1413683_a2878632|
1248505_a2742600|i couldn't believe it and had to read it again.
1184164_a2768403|frankly, it was just poorly organized.
1582205_a2905186|i see.
1181011_a2145383|why did they do it like that?
1247525_a2531583|i know i want to keep on doing sports.
1184367_a2571132|it was nuts.
1209077_a2250040|interesting.
1180097_a1708965|you can also take the classes separately, but it is cheaper to take them at the same time.
1178364_a2888003|well, there were christmas bazaars.
1289462_a2876428|with you, it’s different anyway.
1418889_a2759139|what a pity.
1583882_a2866146|skype.
1180097_a1707691|i didn't know about that, and i didn't know about the current guidelines.
1182062_a2772361|very surprising.
1430628_a2126603|
1290359-12323508-12444739_a2394486|they have headaches all the time.
1429737_a2787233|i was supposed to fingerspell all the cities we passed while we were on the autobahn until i was able to do it correctly.
1292770_a2394604|b, c, and d.
1176624_a2895761|someone asked me, “so you want to make pasta?”
1584545_a2199907|in times of the gdr one had to climb up the stairs.
1292545_a2517778|it means that we'll continue to keep in touch, as well.
1209746_a2023636|you had to think fast in this situation, and in this state of panic, it didn‘t really matter where you went.
1585089_a3107307|did you see the boxing match yesterday? that was exciting, wasn’t it? did you think so, too?
1290754_a3173351|i take my hat off to them.
1182801_a1944121|i think i have to invest my money elsewhere.
1248941-12070517-12233223_a2899775|later on, she asked me whether i wanted a ci.
1584198_a2660001|i also recently learned about something that i thought was shocking.
1209746_a2029472|the garbage was spread out everywhere.
1177860_a3176994|the measurements/
1584545_a2675544|we usually have plum cake.
1290754_a3172018|i can’t just stubbornly quit my position for the whole area of münster as well as for the center.
1177860_a3202411|they found one girl under the ruins.
1428905_a2428927|i couldn't even imagine it.
1200691_a2173150|my son is hard of hearing.
1178147_a2720388|at least the event throughout the day was really nice.
1209495-10594836-11212321_a2815151|right. i’m basically giving my time to school.
1200691_a2171211|the boss/
1584411_a2876706|you know what that is, right?
1427810_a3033339|i bought them for norway because everything is so expensive over there.
1205503_a2769614|sometimes i pick off a dead leaf.
1210825_a3187870|i was disappointed.
1428038_a2163803|when you're drunk you cannot drive a car properly anymore, but they were not drunk.
1204691_a2805442|i prefer it to be more oral.
1427725_a2115309|i think that is important.
1248862_a2781064|then it was back to work.
1178768_a1996202|i was very sad when he died.
1205568_a2888207|he went to so many firms all by himself!“
1420216_a2760874|a friend of mine managed to get into the newspaper, in a photo.
1583322-12534537-13002913_a2537581|the teachers were pretty bad. they babbled something and that was that, then the greeting, nothing else.
1205821_a2492187|despite the wall being build?
1687803-10331315-10464419_a2002208|wouldn't that be nice?
1584545_a2842938|they usually serve duck or goose.
1585089_a3100814|the defence was sleeping.
1418858_a2942701|i took a trip with our school to the first one.
1179224_a3275794|it just wouldn’t be the same in north rhine-westphalia, because during delivery it looses its taste.
1181159_a3218502|i always had to think of them, and it really hurt.
1176624_a2886513|let me tell you quickly how i learned how to cook.
1290126_a3256986|it used to be the national team in the eastern bloc.
1250972_a2771295|but it's hard.
1582654_a2659356|i‘m not done yet.
1209309-13344230-13420819_a2787527|but my mother of all people is a chain smoker.
1584545_a2202730|if the traffic light is green, one can go up.
1177918_a2881402|france's defense!
1413703_a2310434|that‘s a danger.
1420216_a2761440|that's so true!
1251334_a3015857|i joined the team as a hammer thrower.
1414563_a3073504|so it started in the morning and went on until 6 p.m.
1429124-13403249-13545507_a2943199|you played soccer yesterday, didn’t you?
1291572_a2564928|it wasn't so bad after all, later they went to realschule [type of secondary school in germany] and then to grammar school.
1247205_a2211507|i realized that there was a broken side view mirror dangling on another car, as well.
1246772_a2388809|that's only an hour away.
1249542_a2758630|the opening ceremony of the deaf way ii was really nice.
2025500_a3264390|his son, however, was against the father‘s political ideas.
1249741_a2771059|next to it is another exhibition about the history of world warfare.
1181455_a2296861|what about you?
1290581_a2936000|“you have to go to see a dermatologist.“
1206010_a2732059|it is nice to know two cultures.
1291572_a2614962|you/
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2282788|he said that it was new to him that there were deaf psychologists.
1246344_a2465740|they only talked.
2935384-11295937-11502021_a2950246|i asked if the hearing are open or rather have some reservations towards using signs.
1413683_a2563255|even though i was in relationships a couple of times, it just wouldn't work out. we split up each time.
1210825_a3288697|the teacher also said that that isn’t true.
1244796_a2847976|yes. i did/
1181011_a2144153|
1248400_a2752545|so the process of sending everything back and forth works well.
1250279_a2941076|no, i need to pay the woman calling on my behalf myself.
1246329_a2763966|its name used to be camberg instead of bad camberg.
1428472_a3218925|it’s better, if all languages remain different, for example in spain/
1292768_a2386535|in some city.
1430396_a3687032|ah, you moved to hagen.
1245462_a2372634|i wasn't at the deaflympics myself.
1290581_a2955348|they showed on the tv there/
1246772_a2388547|if these things are clear, everything else can be worked out.
1220196-12291229-12432115_a1767630|then i had my second child.
1584411_a2139057|but i had brought nothing for me and the person accompanying me.
1184756_a3077311|i told him, “wait a second! i’m still pondering.”
1181602_a3085850|the articulation exercises were done with a lot of pressure, and i had to sit through them.
1246102_a2819327|she then mobilized the deaf community, and because the deaf people weren't able to call the hotline for her, the information was spread to vote for her online.
1247205_a2211005|i wasn't really able to commit a hit-and-run offense.
1212416_a2476753|but it was too late.
1181240-15572825-16003603_a3187052|tooth brushing, washing the face and things like that are for later, first she needs to get dressed.
1177702_a2874396|i have one weak spot: saving water.
1250646_a3099248|that were the weltmeister [world champion] washing machines back then [the so-called wellenradwaschmaschine, engl. shaft wheel washing machine, was abbreviated with ”wm”, just like the german word for world championship. the informant seems to have gotten the meaning of that abbreviation confused.].
1291636_a3095822|the bomb then exploded on the ground floor and the fluid escaped.
1210763_a2740447|do you snowboard?
1427158-11470746-12015917_a2300734|the house boat had the motor of a pedal boat.
1245462_a2270940|my name, for example, #name1 is a typical german name.
1179224_a3253374|i think it would be better if the two of us tried to get back to the actual topic of discussion.
1249542_a2759449|i got a receipt and a lid.
1209006_a2842157|i have never counted them, so i don't know.
1204239_a2623252|not him, either.
1181011_a2144009|but this concept was still strongly opposed among the people. some of them formed groups. the concepts of the groups differed from group to group.
1289462_a2397587|so are you in favor of closing german nuclear power stations?
1212402_a2772225|the master craftswoman put the plans i drew away.
1250279_a2935590|i do that, too.
1249620_a3045142|it is a huge difference.
1247205_a2212646|
1182517_a2335816|it was possible to have different opinions.
1180097_a1683994|we were driving on the autobahn, and it's pouring rain. i was driving over 100km/h, well around 90 km/h to 100km/h.
1210208_a3917655|also the sports grant application.
